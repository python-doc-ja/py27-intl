 .. ctype:: PyCObject
 
    This subtype of :ctype:`PyObject` represents an opaque value, useful for C
    extension modules who need to pass an opaque value (as a :ctype:`void\*`
    pointer) through Python code to other C code.  It is often used to make a C
    function pointer defined in one module available to other modules, so the
    regular import mechanism can be used to access C APIs defined in dynamically
    loaded modules.
