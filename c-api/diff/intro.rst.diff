 Include Files
 =============
 
 All function, type and macro definitions needed to use the Python/C API are
 included in your code by the following line::
 
    #include "Python.h"
 
 This implies inclusion of the following standard headers: ``<stdio.h>``,
 ``<string.h>``, ``<errno.h>``, ``<limits.h>``, and ``<stdlib.h>`` (if
 available).
 
-.. warning::
+.. note::
 
    Since Python may define some pre-processor definitions which affect the standard
    headers on some systems, you *must* include :file:`Python.h` before any standard
    headers are included.
 
 All user visible names defined by Python.h (except those defined by the included
 standard headers) have one of the prefixes ``Py`` or ``_Py``.  Names beginning
 with ``_Py`` are for internal use by the Python implementation and should not be
 used by extension writers. Structure member names do not have a reserved prefix.
 
 **Important:** user code should never define names that begin with ``Py`` or
 ``_Py``.  This confuses the reader, and jeopardizes the portability of the user
