 Old Buffer Protocol
 ===================
 
-
 This section describes the legacy buffer protocol, which has been introduced
 in Python 1.6. It is still supported but deprecated in the Python 2.x series.
 Python 3.0 introduces a new buffer protocol which fixes weaknesses and
 shortcomings of the protocol, and has been backported to Python 2.6.  See
 :ref:`bufferobjects` for more information.
 
 
 .. cfunction:: int PyObject_AsCharBuffer(PyObject *obj, const char **buffer, Py_ssize_t *buffer_len)
 
    Returns a pointer to a read-only memory location usable as character-based
    input.  The *obj* argument must support the single-segment character buffer
    interface.  On success, returns ``0``, sets *buffer* to the memory location
