 .. class:: scheduler(timefunc, delayfunc)
 
    The :class:`scheduler` class defines a generic interface to scheduling events.
    It needs two functions to actually deal with the "outside world" --- *timefunc*
    should be callable without arguments, and return  a number (the "time", in any
    units whatsoever).  The *delayfunc* function should be callable with one
    argument, compatible with the output of *timefunc*, and should delay that many
    time units. *delayfunc* will also be called with the argument ``0`` after each
    event is run to allow other threads an opportunity to run in multi-threaded
    applications.
