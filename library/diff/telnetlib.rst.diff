 .. class:: Telnet([host[, port[, timeout]]])
 
    :class:`Telnet` represents a connection to a Telnet server. The instance is
    initially not connected by default; the :meth:`open` method must be used to
    establish a connection.  Alternatively, the host name and optional port
-   and timeout can be passed to the constructor, in which case the connection to
-   the server will be established before the constructor returns.  The optional
-   *timeout* parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for the connection attempt (if

    This class has many :meth:`read_\*` methods.  Note that some of them  raise
    :exc:`EOFError` when the end of the connection is read, because they can return
    an empty string for other reasons.  See the individual descriptions below.
