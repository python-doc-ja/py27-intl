+The database objects returned by :func:`.open` provide the methods  common to all
 the DBM-style databases and mapping objects.  The following methods are
 available in addition to the standard methods.
 
 
 .. method:: dbhash.first()
 
    It's possible to loop over every key/value pair in the database using this
-   method   and the :meth:`next` method.  The traversal is ordered by the databases
+   method and the :meth:`!next` method.  The traversal is ordered by the databases
    internal hash values, and won't be sorted by the key values.  This method
    returns the starting key.
 
 
 .. method:: dbhash.last()
 
    Return the last key/value pair in a database traversal.  This may be used to
    begin a reverse-order traversal; see :meth:`previous`.
 
 
 .. method:: dbhash.next()
