       Write only mode.
 
    Note that it does not allow read/write WAV files.
 
    A *mode* of ``'r'`` or ``'rb'`` returns a :class:`Wave_read` object, while a
    *mode* of ``'w'`` or ``'wb'`` returns a :class:`Wave_write` object.  If *mode*
    is omitted and a file-like  object is passed as *file*, ``file.mode`` is used as
    the default value for *mode* (the ``'b'`` flag is still added if  necessary).
