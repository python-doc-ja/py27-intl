 According to the dictionary, a bastion is "a fortified area or position", or
 "something that is considered a stronghold."  It's a suitable name for this
 module, which provides a way to forbid access to certain attributes of an
 object.  It must always be used with the :mod:`rexec` module, in order to allow
 restricted-mode programs access to certain safe attributes of an object, while
 denying access to other, unsafe attributes.
 
 .. I'm concerned that the word 'bastion' won't be understood by people
