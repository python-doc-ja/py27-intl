 .. function:: decompress(string[, wbits[, bufsize]])
 
    Decompresses the data in *string*, returning a string containing the
    uncompressed data.  The *wbits* parameter controls the size of the window
-   buffer.  If *bufsize* is given, it is used as the initial size of the output
+   buffer, and is discussed further below.
+   If *bufsize* is given, it is used as the initial size of the output
    buffer.  Raises the :exc:`error` exception if any error occurs.
 
    The absolute value of *wbits* is the base two logarithm of the size of the
    history buffer (the "window size") used when compressing data.  Its absolute
    value should be between 8 and 15 for the most recent versions of the zlib
    library, larger values resulting in better compression at the expense of greater
-   memory usage.  The default value is 15.  When *wbits* is negative, the standard
-   :program:`gzip` header is suppressed; this is an undocumented feature of the
-   zlib library, used for compatibility with :program:`unzip`'s compression file
-   format.
+   memory usage.  When decompressing a stream, *wbits* must not be smaller
+   than the size originally used to compress the stream; using a too-small
+   value will result in an exception. The default value is therefore the

+   :program:`gzip` header is suppressed.
 
    *bufsize* is the initial size of the buffer used to hold decompressed data.  If
    more space is required, the buffer size will be increased as needed, so you
    don't have to get this value exactly right; tuning it will only save a few calls
    to :cfunc:`malloc`.  The default size is 16384.
 
 
 .. function:: decompressobj([wbits])
 
    Returns a decompression object, to be used for decompressing data streams that
    won't fit into memory at once.  The *wbits* parameter controls the size of the
    window buffer.
