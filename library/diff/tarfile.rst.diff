 .. method:: TarFile.extractfile(member)
 
    Extract a member from the archive as a file object. *member* may be a filename
    or a :class:`TarInfo` object. If *member* is a regular file, a file-like object
    is returned. If *member* is a link, a file-like object is constructed from the
    link's target. If *member* is none of the above, :const:`None` is returned.
 
    .. note::
 
-      The file-like object is read-only and provides the following methods:
-      :meth:`read`, :meth:`readline`, :meth:`readlines`, :meth:`seek`, :meth:`tell`.
+      The file-like object is read-only.  It provides the methods
+      :meth:`read`, :meth:`readline`, :meth:`readlines`, :meth:`seek`, :meth:`tell`,
+      and :meth:`close`, and also supports iteration over its lines.
 
 
 .. method:: TarFile.add(name, arcname=None, recursive=True, exclude=None)
 
    Add the file *name* to the archive. *name* may be any type of file (directory,
    fifo, symbolic link, etc.). If given, *arcname* specifies an alternative name
    for the file in the archive. Directories are added recursively by default. This
    can be avoided by setting *recursive* to :const:`False`. If *exclude* is given
    it must be a function that takes one filename argument and returns a boolean
    value. Depending on this value the respective file is either excluded
    (:const:`True`) or added (:const:`False`).
