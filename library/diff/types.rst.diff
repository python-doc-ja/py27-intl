 .. data:: MemberDescriptorType
 
    The type of objects defined in extension modules with ``PyMemberDef``, such
    as ``datetime.timedelta.days``.  This type is used as descriptor for simple C
    data members which use standard conversion functions; it has the same purpose
    as the :class:`property` type, but for classes defined in extension modules.

 .. data:: StringTypes
 
    A sequence containing ``StringType`` and ``UnicodeType`` used to facilitate
    easier checking for any string object.  Using this is more portable than using a
    sequence of the two string types constructed elsewhere since it only contains
    ``UnicodeType`` if it has been built in the running version of Python.  For
    example: ``isinstance(s, types.StringTypes)``.
