    this; your code should not rely on a temporary file created using this
    function having or not having a visible name in the file system.
 
    The *mode* parameter defaults to ``'w+b'`` so that the file created can
    be read and written without being closed.  Binary mode is used so that it
    behaves consistently on all platforms without regard for the data that is
    stored.  *bufsize* defaults to ``-1``, meaning that the operating system
    default is used.
 
    The *dir*, *prefix* and *suffix* parameters are passed to :func:`mkstemp`.

    This function operates exactly as :func:`TemporaryFile` does, except that
    the file is guaranteed to have a visible name in the file system (on
    Unix, the directory entry is not unlinked).  That name can be retrieved
    from the :attr:`name` member of the file object.  Whether the name can be
    used to open the file a second time, while the named temporary file is
    still open, varies across platforms (it can be so used on Unix; it cannot
    on Windows NT or later).  If *delete* is true (the default), the file is
    deleted as soon as it is closed.
