 Completer Objects
 -----------------
 
 Completer objects have the following method:
 
 
 .. method:: Completer.complete(text, state)
 
-   Return the *state*th completion for *text*.
+   Return the *state*\ th completion for *text*.
 
    If called for *text* that doesn't include a period character (``'.'``), it will
    complete from names currently defined in :mod:`__main__`, :mod:`__builtin__` and
    keywords (as defined by the :mod:`keyword` module).
 
    If called for a dotted name, it will try to evaluate anything without obvious
    side-effects (functions will not be evaluated, but it can generate calls to
    :meth:`__getattr__`) up to the last part, and find matches for the rest via the
    :func:`dir` function.  Any exception raised during the evaluation of the
    expression is caught, silenced and :const:`None` is returned.
