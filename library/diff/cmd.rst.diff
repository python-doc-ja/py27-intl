    This method will return when the :meth:`postcmd` method returns a true value.
    The *stop* argument to :meth:`postcmd` is the return value from the command's
    corresponding :meth:`do_\*` method.
 
    If completion is enabled, completing commands will be done automatically, and
    completing of commands args is done by calling :meth:`complete_foo` with
    arguments *text*, *line*, *begidx*, and *endidx*.  *text* is the string prefix
    we are attempting to match: all returned matches must begin with it. *line* is
    the current input line with leading whitespace removed, *begidx* and *endidx*
    are the beginning and ending indexes of the prefix text, which could be used to
    provide different completion depending upon which position the argument is in.

    Interpret the argument as though it had been typed in response to the prompt.
    This may be overridden, but should not normally need to be; see the
    :meth:`precmd` and :meth:`postcmd` methods for useful execution hooks.  The
    return value is a flag indicating whether interpretation of commands by the
    interpreter should stop.  If there is a :meth:`do_\*` method for the command
    *str*, the return value of that method is returned, otherwise the return value
    from the :meth:`default` method is returned.
