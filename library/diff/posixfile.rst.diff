    The locking operation that this module provides is done better and more portably
    by the :func:`fcntl.lockf` call.
 
 .. index:: single: fcntl() (in module fcntl)
 
 This module implements some additional functionality over the built-in file
 objects.  In particular, it implements file locking, control over the file
 flags, and an easy interface to duplicate the file object. The module defines a
 new file object, the posixfile object.  It has all the standard file object
 methods and adds the methods described below.  This module only works for
 certain flavors of Unix, since it uses :func:`fcntl.fcntl` for file locking.
 
-To instantiate a posixfile object, use the :func:`open` function in the
-:mod:`posixfile` module.  The resulting object looks and feels roughly the same
-as a standard file object.

 The :mod:`posixfile` module defines the following constants:
 
 
 .. data:: SEEK_SET
 
    Offset is calculated from the start of the file.
 
 
 .. data:: SEEK_CUR
 
    Offset is calculated from the current position in the file.
