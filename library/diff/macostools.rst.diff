 .. module:: macostools
    :platform: Mac
    :synopsis: Convenience routines for file manipulation.
    :deprecated:
 
 
 This module contains some convenience routines for file-manipulation on the
 Macintosh. All file parameters can be specified as pathnames, :class:`FSRef` or
 :class:`FSSpec` objects.  This module expects a filesystem which supports forked
 files, so it should not be used on UFS partitions.

+.. note::
+
+   This module has been removed in Python 3.0.

-   This module is removed in 3.0.
 
 The :mod:`macostools` module defines the following functions:
 
 
 .. function:: copy(src, dst[, createpath[, copytimes]])
 
    Copy file *src* to *dst*.  If *createpath* is non-zero the folders leading to
    *dst* are created if necessary. The method copies data and resource fork and
    some finder information (creator, type, flags) and optionally the creation,
    modification and backup times (default is to copy them). Custom icons, comments
    and icon position are not copied.
 
+   .. note::
+
+      This function does not work in 64-bit code because it uses APIs that
+      are not available in 64-bit mode.
 
 .. function:: copytree(src, dst)
 
    Recursively copy a file tree from *src* to *dst*, creating folders as needed.
    *src* and *dst* should be specified as pathnames.
 
+   .. note::
+
+      This function does not work in 64-bit code because it uses APIs that
+      are not available in 64-bit mode.
 
 .. function:: mkalias(src, dst)
 
    Create a finder alias *dst* pointing to *src*.
 
+   .. note::
+
+      This function does not work in 64-bit code because it uses APIs that
+      are not available in 64-bit mode.
+
 
 .. function:: touched(dst)
 
    Tell the finder that some bits of finder-information such as creator or type for
    file *dst* has changed. The file can be specified by pathname or fsspec. This
    call should tell the finder to redraw the files icon.
 
    .. deprecated:: 2.6
       The function is a no-op on OS X.
 
 
 .. data:: BUFSIZ
