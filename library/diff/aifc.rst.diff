 :mod:`aifc` --- Read and write AIFF and AIFC files
 ==================================================
 
 .. module:: aifc
    :synopsis: Read and write audio files in AIFF or AIFC format.
 
 
 .. index::
    single: Audio Interchange File Format
    single: AIFF
    single: AIFF-C
 
 This module provides support for reading and writing AIFF and AIFF-C files.
 AIFF is Audio Interchange File Format, a format for storing digital audio
 samples in a file.  AIFF-C is a newer version of the format that includes the
 ability to compress the audio data.

 Audio files have a number of parameters that describe the audio data. The
 sampling rate or frame rate is the number of times per second the sound is
 sampled.  The number of channels indicate if the audio is mono, stereo, or
 quadro.  Each frame consists of one sample per channel.  The sample size is the
 size in bytes of each sample.  Thus a frame consists of
 *nchannels*\**samplesize* bytes, and a second's worth of audio consists of
 *nchannels*\**samplesize*\**framerate* bytes.
 
 For example, CD quality audio has a sample size of two bytes (16 bits), uses two
 channels (stereo) and has a frame rate of 44,100 frames/second.  This gives a
 frame size of 4 bytes (2\*2), and a second's worth occupies 2\*2\*44100 bytes

 .. function:: open(file[, mode])
 
    Open an AIFF or AIFF-C file and return an object instance with methods that are
    described below.  The argument *file* is either a string naming a file or a file
    object.  *mode* must be ``'r'`` or ``'rb'`` when the file must be opened for
    reading, or ``'w'``  or ``'wb'`` when the file must be opened for writing.  If
    omitted, ``file.mode`` is used if it exists, otherwise ``'rb'`` is used.  When
    used for writing, the file object should be seekable, unless you know ahead of
    time how many samples you are going to write in total and use
    :meth:`writeframesraw` and :meth:`setnframes`.

    name of the file ends in ``'.aiff'`` in which case the default is an AIFF file.
