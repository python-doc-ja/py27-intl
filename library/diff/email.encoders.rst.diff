 :mod:`email`: Encoders

 .. module:: email.encoders
    :synopsis: Encoders for email message payloads.
 
 
-When creating :class:`Message` objects from scratch, you often need to encode
-the payloads for transport through compliant mail servers. This is especially
-true for :mimetype:`image/\*` and :mimetype:`text/\*` type messages containing
-binary data.

 The :mod:`email` package provides some convenient encodings in its
 :mod:`encoders` module.  These encoders are actually used by the
-:class:`MIMEAudio` and :class:`MIMEImage` class constructors to provide default
-encodings.  All encoder functions take exactly one argument, the message object
-to encode.  They usually extract the payload, encode it, and reset the payload
-to this newly encoded value.  They should also set the
-:mailheader:`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header as appropriate.

 Here are the encoding functions provided:
 
 
 .. function:: encode_quopri(msg)
 
    Encodes the payload into quoted-printable form and sets the
    :mailheader:`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header to ``quoted-printable`` [#]_.
    This is a good encoding to use when most of your payload is normal printable
    data, but contains a few unprintable characters.
