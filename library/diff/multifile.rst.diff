    Note that this test is used intended as a fast guard for the real boundary
    tests; if it always returns false it will merely slow processing, not cause it
    to fail.
 
 
 .. method:: MultiFile.push(str)
 
    Push a boundary string.  When a decorated version of this boundary  is found as
    an input line, it will be interpreted as a section-divider  or end-marker
    (depending on the decoration, see :rfc:`2045`).  All subsequent reads will
    return the empty string to indicate end-of-file, until a call to :meth:`pop`
-   removes the boundary a or :meth:`next` call reenables it.
+   removes the boundary a or :meth:`.next` call reenables it.
 
    It is possible to push more than one boundary.  Encountering the
    most-recently-pushed boundary will return EOF; encountering any other
    boundary will raise an error.
 
 
 .. method:: MultiFile.pop()
 
    Pop a section boundary.  This boundary will no longer be interpreted as EOF.
