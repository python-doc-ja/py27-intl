    use this parameter.
 
    *offset* may be specified as a non-negative integer offset. mmap references
    will be relative to the offset from the beginning of the file. *offset*
    defaults to 0.  *offset* must be a multiple of the PAGESIZE or
    ALLOCATIONGRANULARITY.
 
    This example shows a simple way of using :class:`mmap`::
 
       import mmap
 
       # write a simple example file
-      with open("hello.txt", "w") as f:
+      with open("hello.txt", "wb") as f:
           f.write("Hello Python!\n")
 
-      with open("hello.txt", "r+") as f:
+      with open("hello.txt", "r+b") as f:
           # memory-map the file, size 0 means whole file
           map = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
           # read content via standard file methods
           print map.readline()  # prints "Hello Python!"
           # read content via slice notation
           print map[:5]  # prints "Hello"
           # update content using slice notation;
           # note that new content must have same size
           map[6:] = " world!\n"
           # ... and read again using standard file methods
           map.seek(0)
           print map.readline()  # prints "Hello  world!"
