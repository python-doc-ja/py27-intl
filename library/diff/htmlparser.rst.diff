 .. method:: HTMLParser.handle_comment(data)
 
    This method is called when a comment is encountered.  The *comment* argument is
    a string containing the text between the ``--`` and ``--`` delimiters, but not
    the delimiters themselves.  For example, the comment ``<!--text-->`` will cause
    this method to be called with the argument ``'text'``.  It is intended to be
    overridden by a derived class; the base class implementation does nothing.
 
 
 .. method:: HTMLParser.handle_decl(decl)
 
-   Method called when an SGML declaration is read by the parser.  The *decl*
-   parameter will be the entire contents of the declaration inside the ``<!``...\
-   ``>`` markup.  It is intended to be overridden by a derived class; the base
-   class implementation does nothing.
+   Method called when an SGML ``doctype`` declaration is read by the parser.
+   The *decl* parameter will be the entire contents of the declaration inside
+   the ``<!...>`` markup.  It is intended to be overridden by a derived class;
+   the base class implementation does nothing.

+
+.. method:: HTMLParser.unknown_decl(data)
+
+   Method called when an unrecognized SGML declaration is read by the parser.
+   The *data* parameter will be the entire contents of the declaration inside
+   the ``<!...>`` markup.  It is sometimes useful to be be overridden by a
+   derived class; the base class implementation throws an :exc:`HTMLParseError`.
 
 
 .. method:: HTMLParser.handle_pi(data)
 
    Method called when a processing instruction is encountered.  The *data*
    parameter will contain the entire processing instruction. For example, for the
    processing instruction ``<?proc color='red'>``, this method would be called as
    ``handle_pi("proc color='red'")``.  It is intended to be overridden by a derived
    class; the base class implementation does nothing.
