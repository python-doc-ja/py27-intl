 .. function:: glob(pathname)
 
    Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match *pathname*, which must be
    a string containing a path specification. *pathname* can be either absolute
    (like :file:`/usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile`) or relative (like
    :file:`../../Tools/\*/\*.gif`), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken
    symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell).
 
 
 .. function:: iglob(pathname)
 
-   Return an iterator which yields the same values as :func:`glob` without actually
-   storing them all simultaneously.

    .. versionadded:: 2.5
 
 For example, consider a directory containing only the following files:
 :file:`1.gif`, :file:`2.txt`, and :file:`card.gif`.  :func:`glob` will produce
 the following results.  Notice how any leading components of the path are
 preserved. ::
 
    >>> import glob
    >>> glob.glob('./[0-9].*')
    ['./1.gif', './2.txt']
    >>> glob.glob('*.gif')
