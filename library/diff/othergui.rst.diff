    `PyGTK <http://www.pygtk.org/>`_
       is a set of bindings for the `GTK <http://www.gtk.org/>`_ widget set. It
       provides an object oriented interface that is slightly higher level than
       the C one. It comes with many more widgets than Tkinter provides, and has
       good Python-specific reference documentation. There are also bindings to
       `GNOME <http://www.gnome.org>`_.  One well known PyGTK application is
       `PythonCAD <http://www.pythoncad.org/>`_. An online `tutorial
       <http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/index.html>`_ is available.

       PyQt is a :program:`sip`\ -wrapped binding to the Qt toolkit.  Qt is an
       extensive C++ GUI application development framework that is
       available for Unix, Windows and Mac OS X. :program:`sip` is a tool
       for generating bindings for C++ libraries as Python classes, and
       is specifically designed for Python. The *PyQt3* bindings have a
       book, `GUI Programming with Python: QT Edition
       <http://www.commandprompt.com/community/pyqt/>`_ by Boudewijn
       Rempt. The *PyQt4* bindings also have a book, `Rapid GUI Programming
       with Python and Qt <http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html>`_, by Mark
       Summerfield.
