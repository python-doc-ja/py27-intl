 .. function:: check(file_or_dir)
 
    If *file_or_dir* is a directory and not a symbolic link, then recursively
    descend the directory tree named by *file_or_dir*, checking all :file:`.py`
    files along the way.  If *file_or_dir* is an ordinary Python source file, it is
    checked for whitespace related problems.  The diagnostic messages are written to
    standard output using the print statement.
