 The :class:`netrc` class parses and encapsulates the netrc file format used by
 the Unix :program:`ftp` program and other FTP clients.
 
 
 .. class:: netrc([file])
 
    A :class:`netrc` instance or subclass instance encapsulates data from  a netrc
    file.  The initialization argument, if present, specifies the file to parse.  If
    no argument is given, the file :file:`.netrc` in the user's home directory will
    be read.  Parse errors will raise :exc:`NetrcParseError` with diagnostic

    :attr:`filename` is the name of the source file, and :attr:`lineno` gives the
    line number on which the error was found.

 netrc Objects
 -------------
 
 A :class:`netrc` instance has the following methods:
 
 
-.. method:: XXX Class.authenticators(host)
+.. method:: netrc.authenticators(host)
 
    Return a 3-tuple ``(login, account, password)`` of authenticators for *host*.
    If the netrc file did not contain an entry for the given host, return the tuple
    associated with the 'default' entry.  If neither matching host nor default entry
    is available, return ``None``.
 
 
-.. method:: XXX Class.__repr__()
+.. method:: netrc.__repr__()
 
    Dump the class data as a string in the format of a netrc file. (This discards
    comments and may reorder the entries.)
 
 Instances of :class:`netrc` have public instance variables:
 
 
-.. attribute:: XXX Class.hosts
+.. attribute:: netrc.hosts
 
    Dictionary mapping host names to ``(login, account, password)`` tuples.  The
    'default' entry, if any, is represented as a pseudo-host by that name.
 
 
-.. attribute:: XXX Class.macros
+.. attribute:: netrc.macros
 
    Dictionary mapping macro names to string lists.
 
 .. note::
 
-   Passwords are limited to a subset of the ASCII character set. Versions of this
-   module prior to 2.3 were extremely limited.  Starting with 2.3, all ASCII
-   punctuation is allowed in passwords.  However, note that whitespace and non-
-   printable characters are not allowed in passwords.  This is a limitation of the
-   way the .netrc file is parsed and may be removed in the future.
