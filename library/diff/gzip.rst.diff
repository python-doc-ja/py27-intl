    The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from ``1`` to ``9`` controlling the
    level of compression; ``1`` is fastest and produces the least compression, and
    ``9`` is slowest and produces the most compression.  The default is ``9``.
 
    Calling a :class:`GzipFile` object's :meth:`close` method does not close
    *fileobj*, since you might wish to append more material after the compressed
    data.  This also allows you to pass a :class:`StringIO` object opened for
    writing as *fileobj*, and retrieve the resulting memory buffer using the
    :class:`StringIO` object's :meth:`getvalue` method.
 
+   :class:`GzipFile` supports iteration.
 
 .. function:: open(filename[, mode[, compresslevel]])
 
    This is a shorthand for ``GzipFile(filename,`` ``mode,`` ``compresslevel)``.
    The *filename* argument is required; *mode* defaults to ``'rb'`` and
    *compresslevel* defaults to ``9``.
