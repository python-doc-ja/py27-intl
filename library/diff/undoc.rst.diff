 The idea and original contents for this chapter were taken from a posting by
 Fredrik Lundh; the specific contents of this chapter have been substantially
 revised.
 
 
 Miscellaneous useful utilities
 ==============================
 
 Some of these are very old and/or not very robust; marked with "hmm."
 
 :mod:`ihooks`
-   --- Import hook support (for :mod:`rexec`; may become obsolete).

 Platform specific modules
 =========================
 
 These modules are used to implement the :mod:`os.path` module, and are not
 documented beyond this mention.  There's little need to document these.
 
 :mod:`ntpath`
    --- Implementation of :mod:`os.path` on Win32, Win64, WinCE, and OS/2 platforms.
 
 :mod:`posixpath`
    --- Implementation of :mod:`os.path` on POSIX.
 
 :mod:`bsddb185`
    --- Backwards compatibility module for systems which still use the Berkeley DB
    1.85 module.  It is normally only available on certain BSD Unix-based systems.
    It should never be used directly.
 
 
 Multimedia

-   :mod:`ossaudiodev` module.

+   Removed in Python 3.x.
 
 :mod:`toaiff`
    --- Convert "arbitrary" sound files to AIFF files; should probably become a tool
-   or demo.  Requires the external program :program:`sox`.

    Those which are written in Python will be installed into the directory
    \file{lib-old/} installed as part of the standard library.  To use
