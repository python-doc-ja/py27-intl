 :mod:`gl` --- *Graphics Library* interface
 ==========================================
 
 .. module:: gl
    :platform: IRIX
    :synopsis: Functions from the Silicon Graphics Graphics Library.
    :deprecated:
 
 
 .. deprecated:: 2.6
     The :mod:`gl` module has been deprecated for removal in Python 3.0.
 
 
 This module provides access to the Silicon Graphics *Graphics Library*. It is
 available only on Silicon Graphics machines.
 
 .. warning::
 
-   Some illegal calls to the GL library cause the Python interpreter to dump core.
-   In particular, the use of most GL calls is unsafe before the first window is
-   opened.

 The module is too large to document here in its entirety, but the following
 should help you to get started. The parameter conventions for the C functions
 are translated to Python as follows:
 
 * All (short, long, unsigned) int values are represented by Python integers.
 
 * All float and double values are represented by Python floating point numbers.
   In most cases, Python integers are also allowed.
 
 * All arrays are represented by one-dimensional Python lists. In most cases,
   tuples are also allowed.
