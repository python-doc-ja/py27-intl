 AppleScript client support is built. It also imports and re-exports the core
 functionality of the :mod:`aetypes` and :mod:`aepack` modules. The stub packages
 generated by :mod:`gensuitemodule` import the relevant portions of
 :mod:`aetools`, so usually you do not need to import it yourself. The exception
 to this is when you cannot use a generated suite package and need lower-level
 access to scripting.
 
 The :mod:`aetools` module itself uses the AppleEvent support provided by the
 :mod:`Carbon.AE` module. This has one drawback: you need access to the window
 manager, see section :ref:`osx-gui-scripts` for details. This restriction may be
 lifted in future releases.

 The :mod:`aetools` module defines the following functions:
 
 
 .. function:: packevent(ae, parameters, attributes)
 
    Stores parameters and attributes in a pre-created ``Carbon.AE.AEDesc`` object.
    ``parameters`` and ``attributes`` are  dictionaries mapping 4-character OSA
    parameter keys to Python objects. The objects are packed using
    ``aepack.pack()``.
