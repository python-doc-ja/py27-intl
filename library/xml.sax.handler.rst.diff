 .. class:: ErrorHandler
 
    Interface used by the parser to present error and warning messages to the
    application.  The methods of this object control whether errors are immediately
    converted to exceptions or are handled in some other way.
 
 In addition to these classes, :mod:`xml.sax.handler` provides symbolic constants
 for the feature and property names.

-   read/write
+   | value: ``"http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces"``

-   Value: ``"http://xml.org/sax/features/string-interning"`` ---  true: All element
-   names, prefixes, attribute names, Namespace URIs, and local names are interned
