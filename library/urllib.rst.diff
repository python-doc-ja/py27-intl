 This module provides a high-level interface for fetching data across the World
 Wide Web.  In particular, the :func:`urlopen` function is similar to the
 built-in function :func:`open`, but accepts Universal Resource Locators (URLs)
 instead of filenames.  Some restrictions apply --- it can only open URLs for
 reading, and no seek operations are available.

 .. function:: urlopen(url[, data[, proxies]])
 
    Open a network object denoted by a URL for reading.  If the URL does not have a
    scheme identifier, or if it has :file:`file:` as its scheme identifier, this
    opens a local file (without universal newlines); otherwise it opens a socket to
    a server somewhere on the network.  If the connection cannot be made the
    :exc:`IOError` exception is raised.  If all went well, a file-like object is
    returned.  This supports the following methods: :meth:`read`, :meth:`readline`,

 .. data:: _urlopener
 
    The public functions :func:`urlopen` and :func:`urlretrieve` create an instance
    of the :class:`FancyURLopener` class and use it to perform their requested
    actions.  To override this functionality, programmers can create a subclass of
    :class:`URLopener` or :class:`FancyURLopener`, then assign an instance of that
    class to the ``urllib._urlopener`` variable before calling the desired function.
    For example, applications may want to specify a different
    :mailheader:`User-Agent` header than :class:`URLopener` defines.  This can be
    accomplished with the following code::

    ``key=value`` pairs separated by ``'&'`` characters, where both *key* and
    *value* are quoted using :func:`quote_plus` above.  When a sequence of
    two-element tuples is used as the *query* argument, the first element of

    can be a sequence and in that case, if the optional parameter *doseq* is

    :func:`parse_qs` and :func:`parse_qsl` which are used to parse query strings
    into Python data structures.

 * The code handling the FTP protocol cannot differentiate between a file and a
   directory.  This can lead to unexpected behavior when attempting to read a URL
   that points to a file that is not accessible.  If the URL ends in a ``/``, it is
   assumed to refer to a directory and will be handled accordingly.  But if an
   attempt to read a file leads to a 550 error (meaning the URL cannot be found or
   is not accessible, often for permission reasons), then the path is treated as a
   directory in order to handle the case when a directory is specified by a URL but
   the trailing ``/`` has been left off.  This can cause misleading results when
   you try to fetch a file whose read permissions make it inaccessible; the FTP
