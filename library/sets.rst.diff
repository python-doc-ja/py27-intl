 The :mod:`sets` module provides classes for constructing and manipulating
 unordered collections of unique elements.  Common uses include membership
 testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and computing standard math
 operations on sets such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric
 difference.
 
 Like other collections, sets support ``x in set``, ``len(set)``, and ``for x in
 set``.  Being an unordered collection, sets do not record element position or
 order of insertion.  Accordingly, sets do not support indexing, slicing, or
 other sequence-like behavior.
