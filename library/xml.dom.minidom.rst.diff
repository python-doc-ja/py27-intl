 .. method:: Node.unlink()
 
    Break internal references within the DOM so that it will be garbage collected on
    versions of Python without cyclic GC.  Even when cyclic GC is available, using
    this can make large amounts of memory available sooner, so calling this on DOM
    objects as soon as they are no longer needed is good practice.  This only needs
    to be called on the :class:`Document` object, but may be called on child nodes
    to discard children of that node.
 
 
-.. method:: Node.writexml(writer[, indent=""[, addindent=""[, newl=""[, encoding=""]]]])
+.. method:: Node.writexml(writer[, indent=""[, addindent=""[, newl=""]]])
 
    Write XML to the writer object.  The writer should have a :meth:`write` method
    which matches that of the file object interface.  The *indent* parameter is the
    indentation of the current node.  The *addindent* parameter is the incremental
    indentation to use for subnodes of the current one.  The *newl* parameter
    specifies the string to use to terminate newlines.
 
+   For the :class:`Document` node, an additional keyword argument *encoding* can
+   be used to specify the encoding field of the XML header.
+
    .. versionchanged:: 2.1
       The optional keyword parameters *indent*, *addindent*, and *newl* were added to
       support pretty output.
 
    .. versionchanged:: 2.3
       For the :class:`Document` node, an additional keyword argument
       *encoding* can be used to specify the encoding field of the XML header.
 
 
 .. method:: Node.toxml([encoding])
 
    Return the XML that the DOM represents as a string.
