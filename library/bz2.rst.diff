    exist, and truncated otherwise. If *buffering* is given, ``0`` means
    unbuffered, and larger numbers specify the buffer size; the default is
    ``0``. If *compresslevel* is given, it must be a number between ``1`` and
    ``9``; the default is ``9``. Add a ``'U'`` to mode to open the file for input
    with universal newline support. Any line ending in the input file will be
    seen as a ``'\n'`` in Python.  Also, a file so opened gains the attribute
    :attr:`newlines`; the value for this attribute is one of ``None`` (no newline
    read yet), ``'\r'``, ``'\n'``, ``'\r\n'`` or a tuple containing all the
    newline types seen. Universal newlines are available only when
    reading. Instances support iteration in the same way as normal :class:`file`
    instances.

    .. method:: close()
 
       Close the file. Sets data attribute :attr:`closed` to true. A closed file
       cannot be used for further I/O operations. :meth:`close` may be called
       more than once without error.
 
 
    .. method:: read([size])
 
       Read at most *size* uncompressed bytes, returned as a string. If the
       *size* argument is negative or omitted, read until EOF is reached.
