 :mod:`email`: Examples
 ----------------------
 
 Here are a few examples of how to use the :mod:`email` package to read, write,
 and send simple email messages, as well as more complex MIME messages.
 
 First, let's see how to create and send a simple text message:
 
 .. literalinclude:: ../includes/email-simple.py
 
 
+And parsing RFC822 headers can easily be done by the parse(filename) or
+parsestr(message_as_string) methods of the Parser() class:
+
+.. literalinclude:: ../includes/email-headers.py
+
+
 Here's an example of how to send a MIME message containing a bunch of family
 pictures that may be residing in a directory:
 
 .. literalinclude:: ../includes/email-mime.py
 
 
 Here's an example of how to send the entire contents of a directory as an email
 message: [1]_
 
 .. literalinclude:: ../includes/email-dir.py
