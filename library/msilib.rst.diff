    Create a new directory in the Directory table. There is a current component at
    each point in time for the directory, which is either explicitly created through
    :meth:`start_component`, or implicitly when files are added for the first time.
    Files are added into the current component, and into the cab file.  To create a
    directory, a base directory object needs to be specified (can be ``None``), the
    path to the physical directory, and a logical directory name.  *default*
    specifies the DefaultDir slot in the directory table. *componentflags* specifies
    the default flags that new components get.
