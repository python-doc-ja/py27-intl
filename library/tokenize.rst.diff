    :synopsis: Lexical scanner for Python source code.

 The :mod:`tokenize` module provides a lexical scanner for Python source code,
 implemented in Python.  The scanner in this module returns comments as tokens as
 well, making it useful for implementing "pretty-printers," including colorizers
 for on-screen displays.

 The primary entry point is a :term:`generator`:
 
 .. function:: generate_tokens(readline)
 
    The :func:`generate_tokens` generator requires one argument, *readline*,
    which must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
    :meth:`readline` method of built-in file objects (see section
    :ref:`bltin-file-objects`).  Each call to the function should return one line
    of input as a string.
 
    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the token
    string; a 2-tuple ``(srow, scol)`` of ints specifying the row and column
