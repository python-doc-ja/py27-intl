 .. module:: shelve
    :synopsis: Python object persistence.
 
 
 .. index:: module: pickle
 
 A "shelf" is a persistent, dictionary-like object.  The difference with "dbm"
 databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be essentially
 arbitrary Python objects --- anything that the :mod:`pickle` module can handle.
 This includes most class instances, recursive data types, and objects containing
 lots of shared  sub-objects.  The keys are ordinary strings.

 .. function:: open(filename[, flag='c'[, protocol=None[, writeback=False]]])
 
    Open a persistent dictionary.  The filename specified is the base filename for
    the underlying database.  As a side-effect, an extension may be added to the
    filename and more than one file may be created.  By default, the underlying
    database file is opened for reading and writing.  The optional *flag* parameter
    has the same interpretation as the *flag* parameter of :func:`anydbm.open`.
 
    By default, version 0 pickles are used to serialize values.  The version of the
    pickle protocol can be specified with the *protocol* parameter.

 Shelf objects support all methods supported by dictionaries.  This eases the
 transition from dictionary based scripts to those requiring persistent storage.
 
 Two additional methods are supported:
 
 .. method:: Shelf.sync()
 
    Write back all entries in the cache if the shelf was opened with *writeback*
    set to :const:`True`.  Also empty the cache and synchronize the persistent
    dictionary on disk, if feasible.  This is called automatically when the shelf
    is closed with :meth:`close`.
