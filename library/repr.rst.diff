    :synopsis: Alternate repr() implementation with size limits.
 .. sectionauthor:: Fred L. Drake, Jr. <fdrake@acm.org>
 
 .. note::
    The :mod:`repr` module has been renamed to :mod:`reprlib` in Python 3.0.  The
    :term:`2to3` tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your
    sources to 3.0.
 
 The :mod:`repr` module provides a means for producing object representations
 with limits on the size of the resulting strings. This is used in the Python
 debugger and may be useful in other contexts as well.
 
+.. seealso::
+
+   Latest version of the `repr module Python source code
+   <http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release27-maint/Lib/repr.py?view=markup>`_
+
 This module provides a class, an instance, and a function:
 
 
 .. class:: Repr()
 
    Class which provides formatting services useful in implementing functions
    similar to the built-in :func:`repr`; size limits for  different object types
    are added to avoid the generation of representations which are excessively long.
 
 
 .. data:: aRepr
