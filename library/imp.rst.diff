    On platforms with threads, a thread executing an import holds an internal lock
    until the import is complete. This lock blocks other threads from doing an
    import until the original import completes, which in turn prevents other threads
    from seeing incomplete module objects constructed by the original thread while
    in the process of completing its import (and the imports, if any, triggered by
    that).

    Once a thread has acquired the import lock, the same thread may acquire it
    again without blocking; the thread must release it once for each time it has
