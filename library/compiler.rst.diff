 The Python compiler package is a tool for analyzing Python source code and
 generating Python bytecode.  The compiler contains libraries to generate an
 abstract syntax tree from Python source code and to generate Python
 :term:`bytecode` from the tree.
 
 The :mod:`compiler` package is a Python source to bytecode translator written in
 Python.  It uses the built-in parser and standard :mod:`parser` module to
-generated a concrete syntax tree.  This tree is used to generate an abstract
+generate a concrete syntax tree.  This tree is used to generate an abstract
 syntax tree (AST) and then Python bytecode.
 
 The full functionality of the package duplicates the built-in compiler provided
 with the Python interpreter.  It is intended to match its behavior almost
 exactly.  Why implement another compiler that does the same thing?  The package
 is useful for a variety of purposes.  It can be modified more easily than the
 built-in compiler.  The AST it generates is useful for analyzing Python source
 code.
 
 This chapter explains how the various components of the :mod:`compiler` package
 work.  It blends reference material with a tutorial.
