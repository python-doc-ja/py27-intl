    :synopsis: Utilities for with-statement contexts.
 
 
 .. versionadded:: 2.5
 
 This module provides utilities for common tasks involving the :keyword:`with`
 statement. For more information see also :ref:`typecontextmanager` and
 :ref:`context-managers`.

 .. function:: contextmanager(func)
 
    This function is a :term:`decorator` that can be used to define a factory
    function for :keyword:`with` statement context managers, without needing to
    create a class or separate :meth:`__enter__` and :meth:`__exit__` methods.

    the error (if any), or ensure that some cleanup takes place. If an exception is
    trapped merely in order to log it or to perform some action (rather than to
    suppress it entirely), the generator must reraise that exception. Otherwise the
    generator context manager will indicate to the :keyword:`with` statement that
    the exception has been handled, and execution will resume with the statement
    immediately following the :keyword:`with` statement.
 
 
 .. function:: nested(mgr1[, mgr2[, ...]])
 
    Combine multiple context managers into a single nested context manager.
 
-   Code like this::
+   This function has been deprecated in favour of the multiple manager form
+   of the :keyword:`with` statement.
+
+   The one advantage of this function over the multiple manager form of the
+   :keyword:`with` statement is that argument unpacking allows it to be
+   used with a variable number of context managers as follows::
 
       from contextlib import nested
 
-      with nested(A(), B(), C()) as (X, Y, Z):
+      with nested(*managers):
           do_something()
 
-   is equivalent to this::
-
-      m1, m2, m3 = A(), B(), C()
-      with m1 as X:
-          with m2 as Y:
-              with m3 as Z:
-                  do_something()
-
    Note that if the :meth:`__exit__` method of one of the nested context managers
    indicates an exception should be suppressed, no exception information will be
    passed to any remaining outer context managers. Similarly, if the
    :meth:`__exit__` method of one of the nested managers raises an exception, any
    previous exception state will be lost; the new exception will be passed to the
    :meth:`__exit__` methods of any remaining outer context managers. In general,
    :meth:`__exit__` methods should avoid raising exceptions, and in particular they
    should not re-raise a passed-in exception.
 
+   This function has two major quirks that have led to it being deprecated. Firstly,
+   as the context managers are all constructed before the function is invoked, the
+   :meth:`__new__` and :meth:`__init__` methods of the inner context managers are
+   not actually covered by the scope of the outer context managers. That means, for
+   example, that using :func:`nested` to open two files is a programming error as the
+   first file will not be closed promptly if an exception is thrown when opening
+   the second file.
+
+   Secondly, if the :meth:`__enter__` method of one of the inner context managers
+   raises an exception that is caught and suppressed by the :meth:`__exit__` method
+   of one of the outer context managers, this construct will raise
+   :exc:`RuntimeError` rather than skipping the body of the :keyword:`with`
+   statement.
+
+   Developers that need to support nesting of a variable number of context managers
+   can either use the :mod:`warnings` module to suppress the DeprecationWarning
+   raised by this function or else use this function as a model for an application
+   specific implementation.
+
+   .. deprecated:: 2.7
+      The with-statement now supports this functionality directly (without the
+      confusing error prone quirks).
 
 .. function:: closing(thing)
 
    Return a context manager that closes *thing* upon completion of the block.  This
    is basically equivalent to::
 
       from contextlib import contextmanager
 
       @contextmanager
       def closing(thing):
           try:
               yield thing
