 While these are technically built-in exceptions, they are documented here,
 because conceptually they belong to the warnings mechanism.
 
 User code can define additional warning categories by subclassing one of the
 standard warning categories.  A warning category must always be a subclass of
 the :exc:`Warning` class.

 The Warnings Filter
 -------------------
 
 The warnings filter controls whether warnings are ignored, displayed, or turned
 into errors (raising an exception).
 
 Conceptually, the warnings filter maintains an ordered list of filter
 specifications; any specific warning is matched against each filter
 specification in the list in turn until a match is found; the match determines

 * *lineno* is an integer that the line number where the warning occurred must
   match, or ``0`` to match all line numbers.
 
 Since the :exc:`Warning` class is derived from the built-in :exc:`Exception`
 class, to turn a warning into an error we simply raise ``category(message)``.
 
 The warnings filter is initialized by :option:`-W` options passed to the Python
 interpreter command line.  The interpreter saves the arguments for all
 :option:`-W` options without interpretation in ``sys.warnoptions``; the
 :mod:`warnings` module parses these when it is first imported (invalid options
 are ignored, after printing a message to ``sys.stderr``).
 
-The warnings that are ignored by default may be enabled by passing :option:`-Wd`

-those that are normally ignored by default. This is particular useful for
-enabling ImportWarning when debugging problems importing a developed package.
-ImportWarning can also be enabled explicitly in Python code using::

 Temporarily Suppressing Warnings
 --------------------------------
 
 If you are using code that you know will raise a warning, such as a deprecated
 function, but do not want to see the warning, then it is possible to suppress
 the warning using the :class:`catch_warnings` context manager::

 its original value.  Note: this can only be guaranteed in a single-threaded
 application. If two or more threads use the :class:`catch_warnings` context
 manager at the same time, the behavior is undefined.
 
 When testing multiple operations that raise the same kind of warning, it
 is important to test them in a manner that confirms each operation is raising
 a new warning (e.g. set warnings to be raised as exceptions and check the
 operations raise exceptions, check that the length of the warning list
 continues to increase after each operation, or else delete the previous
 entries from the warnings list before each new operation).
 
 
+Updating Code For New Versions of Python
+----------------------------------------
+
+Warnings that are only of interest to the developer are ignored by default. As
+such you should make sure to test your code with typically ignored warnings
+made visible. You can do this from the command-line by passing :option:`-Wd`
+to the interpreter (this is shorthand for :option:`-W default`).  This enables
+default handling for all warnings, including those that are ignored by default.
+To change what action is taken for encountered warnings you simply change what
+argument is passed to :option:`-W`, e.g. :option:`-W error`. See the
+:option:`-W` flag for more details on what is possible.
+
+To programmatically do the same as :option:`-Wd`, use::
+
+  warnings.simplefilter('default')
+
+Make sure to execute this code as soon as possible. This prevents the
+registering of what warnings have been raised from unexpectedly influencing how
+future warnings are treated.
+
+Having certain warnings ignored by default is done to prevent a user from
+seeing warnings that are only of interest to the developer. As you do not
+necessarily have control over what interpreter a user uses to run their code,
+it is possible that a new version of Python will be released between your
+release cycles.  The new interpreter release could trigger new warnings in your
+code that were not there in an older interpreter, e.g.
+:exc:`DeprecationWarning` for a module that you are using. While you as a
+developer want to be notified that your code is using a deprecated module, to a
+user this information is essentially noise and provides no benefit to them.

 Available Functions

 .. function:: warn(message[, category[, stacklevel]])
 
    Issue a warning, or maybe ignore it or raise an exception.  The *category*
    argument, if given, must be a warning category class (see above); it defaults to
    :exc:`UserWarning`.  Alternatively *message* can be a :exc:`Warning` instance,
    in which case *category* will be ignored and ``message.__class__`` will be used.

 .. function:: showwarning(message, category, filename, lineno[, file[, line]])
 
    Write a warning to a file.  The default implementation calls
    ``formatwarning(message, category, filename, lineno, line)`` and writes the
    resulting string to *file*, which defaults to ``sys.stderr``.  You may replace
    this function with an alternative implementation by assigning to
    ``warnings.showwarning``.
    *line* is a line of source code to be included in the warning
    message; if *line* is not supplied, :func:`showwarning` will
    try to read the line specified by *filename* and *lineno*.

 .. function:: formatwarning(message, category, filename, lineno[, line])
 
    Format a warning the standard way.  This returns a string which may contain
    embedded newlines and ends in a newline.  *line* is a line of source code to
    be included in the warning message; if *line* is not supplied,
    :func:`formatwarning` will try to read the line specified by *filename* and
