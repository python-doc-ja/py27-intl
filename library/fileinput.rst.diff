 the list of filenames is noticeable at all is when the last file opened is

 You can control how files are opened by providing an opening hook via the
 *openhook* parameter to :func:`fileinput.input` or :class:`FileInput()`. The
 hook must be a function that takes two arguments, *filename* and *mode*, and
 returns an accordingly opened file-like object. Two useful hooks are already
 provided by this module.

 The following function is the primary interface of this module:
 
 
 .. function:: input([files[, inplace[, backup[, mode[, openhook]]]]])
 
    Create an instance of the :class:`FileInput` class.  The instance will be used
    as global state for the functions of this module, and is also returned to use
    during iteration.  The parameters to this function will be passed along to the
    constructor of the :class:`FileInput` class.
