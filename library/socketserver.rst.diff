 There are various server methods that can be overridden by subclasses of base
 server classes like :class:`TCPServer`; these methods aren't useful to external
 users of the server object.
 
 .. XXX should the default implementations of these be documented, or should
    it be assumed that the user will look at SocketServer.py?
 
 .. method:: BaseServer.finish_request()
 
    Actually processes the request by instantiating :attr:`RequestHandlerClass` and
    calling its :meth:`handle` method.
