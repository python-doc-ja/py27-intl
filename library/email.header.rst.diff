    Optional *s* is the initial header value.  If ``None`` (the default), the
    initial header value is not set.  You can later append to the header with
    :meth:`append` method calls.  *s* may be a byte string or a Unicode string, but
    see the :meth:`append` documentation for semantics.
 
    Optional *charset* serves two purposes: it has the same meaning as the *charset*
    argument to the :meth:`append` method.  It also sets the default character set
    for all subsequent :meth:`append` calls that omit the *charset* argument.  If
    *charset* is not provided in the constructor (the default), the ``us-ascii``
    character set is used both as *s*'s initial charset and as the default for
    subsequent :meth:`append` calls.
