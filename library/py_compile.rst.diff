    name of the source file in error messages instead of *file*.  If *doraise* is
    true, a :exc:`PyCompileError` is raised when an error is encountered while
    compiling *file*. If *doraise* is false (the default), an error string is
    written to ``sys.stderr``, but no exception is raised.
 
 
 .. function:: main([args])
 
    Compile several source files.  The files named in *args* (or on the command
    line, if *args* is not specified) are compiled and the resulting bytecode is
    cached in the normal manner.  This function does not search a directory
    structure to locate source files; it only compiles files named explicitly.
+   If ``'-'`` is the only parameter in args, the list of files is taken from
+   standard input.
+
+   .. versionchanged:: 2.7
+      Added support for ``'-'``.
 
 When this module is run as a script, the :func:`main` is used to compile all the
 files named on the command line.  The exit status is nonzero if one of the files
 could not be compiled.
 
 .. versionchanged:: 2.6
    Added the nonzero exit status when module is run as a script.
