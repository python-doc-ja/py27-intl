 .. module:: linecache
    :synopsis: This module provides random access to individual lines from text files.
 .. sectionauthor:: Moshe Zadka <moshez@zadka.site.co.il>
 
 
 The :mod:`linecache` module allows one to get any line from any file, while
 attempting to optimize internally, using a cache, the common case where many
 lines are read from a single file.  This is used by the :mod:`traceback` module
 to retrieve source lines for inclusion in  the formatted traceback.

+   Latest version of the `linecache module Python source code
+   <http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release27-maint/Lib/linecache.py?view=markup>`_
+
 The :mod:`linecache` module defines the following functions:
 
 
 .. function:: getline(filename, lineno[, module_globals])
 
-   Get line *lineno* from file named *filename*. This function will never throw an
+   Get line *lineno* from file named *filename*. This function will never raise an
    exception --- it will return ``''`` on errors (the terminating newline character
    will be included for lines that are found).
 
    .. index:: triple: module; search; path
 
    If a file named *filename* is not found, the function will look for it in the
    module search path, ``sys.path``, after first checking for a :pep:`302`
    ``__loader__`` in *module_globals*, in case the module was imported from a
    zipfile or other non-filesystem import source.
 
    .. versionadded:: 2.5
       The *module_globals* parameter was added.
