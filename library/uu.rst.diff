 The :mod:`uu` module defines the following functions:
 
 
 .. function:: encode(in_file, out_file[, name[, mode]])
 
    Uuencode file *in_file* into file *out_file*.  The uuencoded file will have the
    header specifying *name* and *mode* as the defaults for the results of decoding
    the file. The default defaults are taken from *in_file*, or ``'-'`` and ``0666``
    respectively.
 
 
 .. function:: decode(in_file[, out_file[, mode[, quiet]]])
