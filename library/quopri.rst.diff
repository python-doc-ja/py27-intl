    single: MIME; quoted-printable encoding
 
 This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding, as
 defined in :rfc:`1521`: "MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One:
 Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies".
 The quoted-printable encoding is designed for data where there are relatively
 few nonprintable characters; the base64 encoding scheme available via the
 :mod:`base64` module is more compact if there are many such characters, as when
 sending a graphics file.

 .. function:: decode(input, output[,header])
 
    Decode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting decoded binary
    data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must either be file objects or
    objects that mimic the file object interface. *input* will be read until
    ``input.readline()`` returns an empty string. If the optional argument *header*
    is present and true, underscore will be decoded as space. This is used to decode
    "Q"-encoded headers as described in :rfc:`1522`: "MIME (Multipurpose Internet
    Mail Extensions) Part Two: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text".
