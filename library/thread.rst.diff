    invalid, a :exc:`ValueError` is raised and the stack size is unmodified.  32kB
    is currently the minimum supported stack size value to guarantee sufficient
    stack space for the interpreter itself.  Note that some platforms may have
    particular restrictions on values for the stack size, such as requiring a
    minimum stack size > 32kB or requiring allocation in multiples of the system
    memory page size - platform documentation should be referred to for more
    information (4kB pages are common; using multiples of 4096 for the stack size is
    the suggested approach in the absence of more specific information).

 Lock objects have the following methods:
 
 
 .. method:: lock.acquire([waitflag])
 
    Without the optional argument, this method acquires the lock unconditionally, if
    necessary waiting until it is released by another thread (only one thread at a
    time can acquire a lock --- that's their reason for existence).  If the integer
    *waitflag* argument is present, the action depends on its value: if it is zero,
    the lock is only acquired if it can be acquired immediately without waiting,
    while if it is nonzero, the lock is acquired unconditionally as before.  The
    return value is ``True`` if the lock is acquired successfully, ``False`` if not.
