 This module provides various time-related functions. For related
 functionality, see also the :mod:`datetime` and :mod:`calendar` modules.
 
 Although this module is always available,
 not all functions are available on all platforms.  Most of the functions
 defined in this module call platform C library functions with the same name.  It
 may sometimes be helpful to consult the platform documentation, because the
 semantics of these functions varies among platforms.
 
 An explanation of some terminology and conventions is in order.
 
-  .. index:: single: epoch
+.. index:: single: epoch
 
 * The :dfn:`epoch` is the point where the time starts.  On January 1st of that
   year, at 0 hours, the "time since the epoch" is zero.  For Unix, the epoch is
   1970.  To find out what the epoch is, look at ``gmtime(0)``.
 
-  .. index:: single: Year 2038
+.. index:: single: Year 2038
 
 * The functions in this module do not handle dates and times before the epoch or
   far in the future.  The cut-off point in the future is determined by the C
   library; for Unix, it is typically in 2038.
 
-  .. index::
-     single: Year 2000
-     single: Y2K
+.. index::
+   single: Year 2000
+   single: Y2K
+
+.. _time-y2kissues:
 
 * **Year 2000 (Y2K) issues**:  Python depends on the platform's C library, which
   generally doesn't have year 2000 issues, since all dates and times are
   represented internally as seconds since the epoch.  Functions accepting a
   :class:`struct_time` (see below) generally require a 4-digit year.  For backward
   compatibility, 2-digit years are supported if the module variable
   ``accept2dyear`` is a non-zero integer; this variable is initialized to ``1``
   unless the environment variable :envvar:`PYTHONY2K` is set to a non-empty
   string, in which case it is initialized to ``0``.  Thus, you can set
   :envvar:`PYTHONY2K` to a non-empty string in the environment to require 4-digit
   years for all year input.  When 2-digit years are accepted, they are converted
   according to the POSIX or X/Open standard: values 69-99 are mapped to 1969-1999,
   and values 0--68 are mapped to 2000--2068. Values 100--1899 are always illegal.
   Note that this is new as of Python 1.5.2(a2); earlier versions, up to Python
   1.5.1 and 1.5.2a1, would add 1900 to year values below 1900.
 
-  .. index::
-     single: UTC
-     single: Coordinated Universal Time
-     single: Greenwich Mean Time
+.. index::
+   single: UTC
+   single: Coordinated Universal Time
+   single: Greenwich Mean Time
 
 * UTC is Coordinated Universal Time (formerly known as Greenwich Mean Time, or
   GMT).  The acronym UTC is not a mistake but a compromise between English and
   French.
 
-  .. index:: single: Daylight Saving Time
+.. index:: single: Daylight Saving Time
 
 * DST is Daylight Saving Time, an adjustment of the timezone by (usually) one
   hour during part of the year.  DST rules are magic (determined by local law) and
   can change from year to year.  The C library has a table containing the local
   rules (often it is read from a system file for flexibility) and is the only
   source of True Wisdom in this respect.
 
 * The precision of the various real-time functions may be less than suggested by
   the units in which their value or argument is expressed. E.g. on most Unix
   systems, the clock "ticks" only 50 or 100 times a second.
 
 * On the other hand, the precision of :func:`time` and :func:`sleep` is better
   than their Unix equivalents: times are expressed as floating point numbers,
   :func:`time` returns the most accurate time available (using Unix
   :cfunc:`gettimeofday` where available), and :func:`sleep` will accept a time
   with a nonzero fraction (Unix :cfunc:`select` is used to implement this, where
   available).
 
 * The time value as returned by :func:`gmtime`, :func:`localtime`, and
   :func:`strptime`, and accepted by :func:`asctime`, :func:`mktime` and
   :func:`strftime`, may be considered as a sequence of 9 integers.  The return
   values of :func:`gmtime`, :func:`localtime`, and :func:`strptime` also offer
   attribute names for individual fields.

    Support for the ``%Z`` directive is based on the values contained in ``tzname``
    and whether ``daylight`` is true.  Because of this, it is platform-specific
    except for recognizing UTC and GMT which are always known (and are considered to
    be non-daylight savings timezones).
 
    Only the directives specified in the documentation are supported.  Because
    ``strftime()`` is implemented per platform it can sometimes offer more
    directives than those listed.  But ``strptime()`` is independent of any platform
    and thus does not necessarily support all directives available that are not
    documented as supported.

 .. function:: time()
 
    Return the time as a floating point number expressed in seconds since the epoch,
    in UTC.  Note that even though the time is always returned as a floating point
    number, not all systems provide time with a better precision than 1 second.
    While this function normally returns non-decreasing values, it can return a
    lower value than a previous call if the system clock has been set back between
    the two calls.
