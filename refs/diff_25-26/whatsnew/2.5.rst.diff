 This article explains the new features in Python 2.5.  The final release of
 Python 2.5 is scheduled for August 2006; :pep:`356` describes the planned
 release schedule.
 
 The changes in Python 2.5 are an interesting mix of language and library
 improvements. The library enhancements will be more important to Python's user
 community, I think, because several widely-useful packages were added.  New
 modules include ElementTree for XML processing (section :ref:`module-etree`),
 the SQLite database module (section :ref:`module-sqlite`), and the :mod:`ctypes`
 module for calling C functions (section :ref:`module-ctypes`).

 handling are handled better (section :ref:`pep-341`).  All these improvements
 are worthwhile, but they're improvements to one specific language feature or
 another; none of them are broad modifications to Python's semantics.
 
 As well as the language and library additions, other improvements and bugfixes
 were made throughout the source tree.  A search through the SVN change logs
 finds there were 353 patches applied and 458 bugs fixed between Python 2.4 and
 2.5.  (Both figures are likely to be underestimates.)
 
 This article doesn't try to be a complete specification of the new features;
 instead changes are briefly introduced using helpful examples.  For full

 PEP 342: New Generator Features
 ===============================
 
 Python 2.5 adds a simple way to pass values *into* a generator. As introduced in
 Python 2.3, generators only produce output; once a generator's code was invoked
 to create an iterator, there was no way to pass any new information into the
 function when its execution is resumed.  Sometimes the ability to pass in some
 information would be useful.  Hackish solutions to this include making the

+for this case.  Don't just use its value in expressions unless you're sure that
+the :meth:`send` method will be the only method used to resume your generator
+function.
 
 In addition to :meth:`send`, there are two other new methods on generators:
 
 * :meth:`throw(type, value=None, traceback=None)` is used to raise an exception
   inside the generator; the exception is raised by the :keyword:`yield` expression
   where the generator's execution is paused.
 
 * :meth:`close` raises a new :exc:`GeneratorExit` exception inside the generator

   If you need to run cleanup code when a :exc:`GeneratorExit` occurs, I suggest
   using a ``try: ... finally:`` suite instead of  catching :exc:`GeneratorExit`.
 
 The cumulative effect of these changes is to turn generators from one-way
 producers of information into both producers and consumers.
 
 Generators also become *coroutines*, a more generalized form of subroutines.
 Subroutines are entered at one point and exited at another point (the top of the
 function, and a :keyword:`return` statement), but coroutines can be entered,
 exited, and resumed at many different points (the :keyword:`yield` statements).
 We'll have to figure out patterns for using coroutines effectively in Python.

 PEP 343: The 'with' statement
 =============================
 
 The ':keyword:`with`' statement clarifies code that previously would use
 ``try...finally`` blocks to ensure that clean-up code is executed.  In this
 section, I'll discuss the statement as it will commonly be used.  In the next
 section, I'll examine the implementation details and show how to write objects
 for use with this statement.
 
 The ':keyword:`with`' statement is a new control-flow structure whose basic
 structure is::
 
    with expression [as variable]:
        with-block
 
 The expression is evaluated, and it should result in an object that supports the
-context management protocol.  This object may return a value that can optionally
-be bound to the name *variable*.  (Note carefully that *variable* is *not*
-assigned the result of *expression*.)  The object can then run set-up code
-before *with-block* is executed and some clean-up code is executed after the
-block is done, even if the block raised an exception.
+context management protocol (that is, has :meth:`__enter__` and :meth:`__exit__`
+methods.
 
-To enable the statement in Python 2.5, you need  to add the following directive
+The object's :meth:`__enter__` is called before *with-block* is executed and
+therefore can run set-up code. It also may return a value that is bound to the
+name *variable*, if given.  (Note carefully that *variable* is *not* assigned
+the result of *expression*.)
+
+After execution of the *with-block* is finished, the object's :meth:`__exit__`
+method is called, even if the block raised an exception, and can therefore run
+clean-up code.
+
+To enable the statement in Python 2.5, you need to add the following directive
 to your module::
 
    from __future__ import with_statement
 
 The statement will always be enabled in Python 2.6.
 
 Some standard Python objects now support the context management protocol and can
 be used with the ':keyword:`with`' statement. File objects are one example::
 
    with open('/etc/passwd', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            print line
            ... more processing code ...
 
 After this statement has executed, the file object in *f* will have been
-automatically closed, even if the 'for' loop raised an exception part-way
-through the block.

+way through the block.
+
+.. note::
+
+   In this case, *f* is the same object created by :func:`open`, because
+   :meth:`file.__enter__` returns *self*.
 
 The :mod:`threading` module's locks and condition variables  also support the
 ':keyword:`with`' statement::
 
    lock = threading.Lock()
    with lock:
        # Critical section of code
        ...
 
 The lock is acquired before the block is executed and always released once  the
 block is complete.

 PEP 353: Using ssize_t as the index type
 ========================================
 
 A wide-ranging change to Python's C API, using a new  :ctype:`Py_ssize_t` type
 definition instead of :ctype:`int`,  will permit the interpreter to handle more
 data on 64-bit platforms. This change doesn't affect Python's capacity on 32-bit
 platforms.
 
 Various pieces of the Python interpreter used C's :ctype:`int` type to store
 sizes or counts; for example, the number of items in a list or tuple were stored
 in an :ctype:`int`.  The C compilers for most 64-bit platforms still define
 :ctype:`int` as a 32-bit type, so that meant that lists could only hold up to
 ``2**31 - 1`` = 2147483647 items. (There are actually a few different
 programming models that 64-bit C compilers can use -- see
-`<http://www.unix.org/version2/whatsnew/lp64_wp.html>`_ for a discussion -- but
-the most commonly available model leaves :ctype:`int` as 32 bits.)
+http://www.unix.org/version2/whatsnew/lp64_wp.html for a discussion -- but the
+most commonly available model leaves :ctype:`int` as 32 bits.)
 
 A limit of 2147483647 items doesn't really matter on a 32-bit platform because
 you'll run out of memory before hitting the length limit. Each list item
 requires space for a pointer, which is 4 bytes, plus space for a
 :ctype:`PyObject` representing the item.  2147483647\*4 is already more bytes
 than a 32-bit address space can contain.
 
 It's possible to address that much memory on a 64-bit platform, however.  The
 pointers for a list that size would only require 16 GiB of space, so it's not
 unreasonable that Python programmers might construct lists that large.
 Therefore, the Python interpreter had to be changed to use some type other than
 :ctype:`int`, and this will be a 64-bit type on 64-bit platforms.  The change

 * The :func:`min` and :func:`max` built-in functions gained a ``key`` keyword
   parameter analogous to the ``key`` argument for :meth:`sort`.  This parameter
   supplies a function that takes a single argument and is called for every value
   in the list; :func:`min`/:func:`max` will return the element with the
   smallest/largest return value from this function. For example, to find the
   longest string in a list, you can do::
 
      L = ['medium', 'longest', 'short']
      # Prints 'longest'
      print max(L, key=len)              
      # Prints 'short', because lexicographically 'short' has the largest value

 * Two new built-in functions, :func:`any` and :func:`all`, evaluate whether an

   if any value returned by the iterator is true; otherwise it will return

 Interactive Interpreter Changes
 -------------------------------
 
 In the interactive interpreter, ``quit`` and ``exit``  have long been strings so
 that new users get a somewhat helpful message when they try to quit::
 
    >>> quit
    'Use Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit.'
 
 In Python 2.5, ``quit`` and ``exit`` are now objects that still produce string
 representations of themselves, but are also callable. Newbies who try ``quit()``
 or ``exit()`` will now exit the interpreter as they expect.  (Implemented by
 Georg Brandl.)
 
 The Python executable now accepts the standard long options  :option:`--help`
 and :option:`--version`; on Windows,  it also accepts the :option:`/?` option
 for displaying a help message. (Implemented by Georg Brandl.)

 Several of the optimizations were developed at the NeedForSpeed sprint, an event
 held in Reykjavik, Iceland, from May 21--28 2006. The sprint focused on speed
 enhancements to the CPython implementation and was funded by EWT LLC with local
 support from CCP Games.  Those optimizations added at this sprint are specially
 marked in the following list.

+SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that
+doesn't require a separate server process and allows accessing the database

+PostgreSQL or Oracle.
+
+pysqlite was written by Gerhard Häring and provides a SQL interface compliant
+with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by :pep:`249`.
 
 If you're compiling the Python source yourself, note that the source tree
 doesn't include the SQLite code, only the wrapper module. You'll need to have
 the SQLite libraries and headers installed before compiling Python, and the
 build process will compile the module when the necessary headers are available.
 
 To use the module, you must first create a :class:`Connection` object that
 represents the database.  Here the data will be stored in the
 :file:`/tmp/example` file::
 
    conn = sqlite3.connect('/tmp/example')
 
 You can also supply the special name ``:memory:`` to create a database in RAM.
 
 Once you have a :class:`Connection`, you can create a :class:`Cursor`  object
 and call its :meth:`execute` method to perform SQL commands::
 
    c = conn.cursor()
 
    # Create table
    c.execute('''create table stocks
-   (date timestamp, trans varchar, symbol varchar,
-    qty decimal, price decimal)''')
+   (date text, trans text, symbol text,
+    qty real, price real)''')

    c.execute("""insert into stocks
              values ('2006-01-05','BUY','RHAT',100,35.14)""")
 
 Usually your SQL operations will need to use values from Python variables.  You
 shouldn't assemble your query using Python's string operations because doing so
 is insecure; it makes your program vulnerable to an SQL injection attack.
 
 Instead, use the DB-API's parameter substitution.  Put ``?`` as a placeholder
 wherever you want to use a value, and then provide a tuple of values as the
 second argument to the cursor's :meth:`execute` method.  (Other database modules

 The wsgiref package
 -------------------
 
 The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) v1.0 defines a standard interface
 between web servers and Python web applications and is described in :pep:`333`.
 The :mod:`wsgiref` package is a reference implementation of the WSGI
 specification.

 The package includes a basic HTTP server that will run a WSGI application; this
 server is useful for debugging but isn't intended for  production use.  Setting
 up a server takes only a few lines of code::
 
    from wsgiref import simple_server
 
    wsgi_app = ...
 
    host = ''
    port = 8000
    httpd = simple_server.make_server(host, port, wsgi_app)

 Build and C API Changes
 =======================
 
 Changes to Python's build process and to the C API include:
 
 * The Python source tree was converted from CVS to Subversion,  in a complex
   migration procedure that was supervised and flawlessly carried out by Martin von
   Löwis.  The procedure was developed as :pep:`347`.
 
 * Coverity, a company that markets a source code analysis tool called Prevent,
   provided the results of their examination of the Python source code.  The
   analysis found about 60 bugs that  were quickly fixed.  Many of the bugs were
   refcounting problems, often occurring in error-handling code.  See
-  `<http://scan.coverity.com>`_ for the statistics.
+  http://scan.coverity.com for the statistics.
 
 * The largest change to the C API came from :pep:`353`, which modifies the
   interpreter to use a :ctype:`Py_ssize_t` type definition instead of
   :ctype:`int`.  See the earlier section :ref:`pep-353` for a discussion of this
   change.
 
 * The design of the bytecode compiler has changed a great deal,  no longer
   generating bytecode by traversing the parse tree.  Instead the parse tree is
   converted to an abstract syntax tree (or AST), and it is  the abstract syntax
   tree that's traversed to produce the bytecode.

   :file:`Include/Python-ast.h`.  The :cfunc:`PyParser_ASTFromString` and
   :cfunc:`PyParser_ASTFromFile`, defined in :file:`Include/pythonrun.h`, take
   Python source as input and return the root of an AST representing the contents.
   This AST can then be turned into a code object by :cfunc:`PyAST_Compile`.  For
   more information, read the source code, and then ask questions on python-dev.
 
   The AST code was developed under Jeremy Hylton's management, and implemented by
   (in alphabetical order) Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Grant Edwards, John
   Ehresman, Kurt Kaiser, Neal Norwitz, Tim Peters, Armin Rigo, and Neil
   Schemenauer, plus the participants in a number of AST sprints at conferences
   such as PyCon.

 * Evan Jones's patch to obmalloc, first described in a talk at PyCon DC 2005,
   was applied.  Python 2.4 allocated small objects in 256K-sized arenas, but never
   freed arenas.  With this patch, Python will free arenas when they're empty.  The
   net effect is that on some platforms, when you allocate many objects, Python's
   memory usage may actually drop when you delete them and the memory may be
   returned to the operating system.  (Implemented by Evan Jones, and reworked by
   Tim Peters.)
 
   Note that this change means extension modules must be more careful when
   allocating memory.  Python's API has many different functions for allocating
   memory that are grouped into families.  For example, :cfunc:`PyMem_Malloc`,

 * The :cfunc:`PyRange_New` function was removed.  It was never documented, never
   used in the core code, and had dangerously lax error checking.  In the unlikely
   case that your extensions were using it, you can replace it by something like
   the following::

 * C API: Many functions now use :ctype:`Py_ssize_t`  instead of :ctype:`int` to
   allow processing more data on 64-bit machines.  Extension code may need to make
   the same change to avoid warnings and to support 64-bit machines.  See the
   earlier section :ref:`pep-353` for a discussion of this change.
 
 * C API:  The obmalloc changes mean that  you must be careful to not mix usage
   of the :cfunc:`PyMem_\*` and :cfunc:`PyObject_\*` families of functions. Memory
   allocated with  one family's :cfunc:`\*_Malloc` must be  freed with the
   corresponding family's :cfunc:`\*_Free` function.
