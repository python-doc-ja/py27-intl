 Mailcap files are used to configure how MIME-aware applications such as mail
 readers and Web browsers react to files with different MIME types. (The name
 "mailcap" is derived from the phrase "mail capability".)  For example, a mailcap
 file might contain a line like ``video/mpeg; xmpeg %s``.  Then, if the user
 encounters an email message or Web document with the MIME type
 :mimetype:`video/mpeg`, ``%s`` will be replaced by a filename (usually one
 belonging to a temporary file) and the :program:`xmpeg` program can be
 automatically started to view the file.
