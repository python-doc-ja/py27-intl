 The :mod:`winsound` module provides access to the basic sound-playing machinery
 provided by Windows platforms.  It includes functions and several constants.
 
 
 .. function:: Beep(frequency, duration)
 
    Beep the PC's speaker. The *frequency* parameter specifies frequency, in hertz,
    of the sound, and must be in the range 37 through 32,767. The *duration*
    parameter specifies the number of milliseconds the sound should last.  If the
    system is not able to beep the speaker, :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised.
 
-   .. note::
-
-      Under Windows 95 and 98, the Windows :cfunc:`Beep` function exists but is
-      useless (it ignores its arguments).  In that case Python simulates it via direct
-      port manipulation (added in version 2.1).  It's unknown whether that will work
-      on all systems.

    .. versionadded:: 1.6
 
 
 .. function:: PlaySound(sound, flags)
 
    Call the underlying :cfunc:`PlaySound` function from the Platform API.  The
    *sound* parameter may be a filename, audio data as a string, or ``None``.  Its
-   interpretation depends on the value of *flags*, which can be a bit-wise ORed
+   interpretation depends on the value of *flags*, which can be a bitwise ORed
    combination of the constants described below.  If the system indicates an error,
    :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised.
 
 
-.. function:: MessageBeep([type=``MB_OK``])
+.. function:: MessageBeep([type=MB_OK])
 
    Call the underlying :cfunc:`MessageBeep` function from the Platform API.  This
    plays a sound as specified in the registry.  The *type* argument specifies which
    sound to play; possible values are ``-1``, ``MB_ICONASTERISK``,
    ``MB_ICONEXCLAMATION``, ``MB_ICONHAND``, ``MB_ICONQUESTION``, and ``MB_OK``, all
    described below.  The value ``-1`` produces a "simple beep"; this is the final
    fallback if a sound cannot be played otherwise.
