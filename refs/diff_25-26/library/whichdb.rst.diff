 :mod:`whichdb` --- Guess which DBM module created a database
 ============================================================
 
 .. module:: whichdb
    :synopsis: Guess which DBM-style module created a given database.
 
+.. note::
+   The :mod:`whichdb` module's only function has been put into the :mod:`dbm`
+   module in Python 3.0.  The :term:`2to3` tool will automatically adapt imports
+   when converting your sources to 3.0.
+
 
 The single function in this module attempts to guess which of the several simple
 database modules available--\ :mod:`dbm`, :mod:`gdbm`, or :mod:`dbhash`\
 --should be used to open a given file.
 
 
 .. function:: whichdb(filename)
 
    Returns one of the following values: ``None`` if the file can't be opened
    because it's unreadable or doesn't exist; the empty string (``''``) if the
    file's format can't be guessed; or a string containing the required module name,
    such as ``'dbm'`` or ``'gdbm'``.
