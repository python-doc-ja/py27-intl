-      native look and feel for applications on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix systems by
-      using each platform's native widgets where ever possible, (GTK+ on Unix-like
-      systems).  In addition to an extensive set of widgets, wxPython provides classes
-      for online documentation and context sensitive help, printing, HTML viewing,
-      low-level device context drawing, drag and drop, system clipboard access, an
-      XML-based resource format and more, including an ever growing library of user-
-      contributed modules.  Both the wxWidgets and wxPython projects are under active
-      development and continuous improvement, and have active and helpful user and
-      developer communities.

+      the popular `wxWidgets <http://www.wxwidgets.org/>`_ (formerly wxWindows)
+      C++ toolkit.  It provides a native look and feel for applications on

+
+PyGTK, PyQt, and wxPython, all have a modern look and feel and more
+widgets than Tkinter. In addition, there are many other GUI toolkits for 
+Python, both cross-platform, and platform-specific. See the `GUI Programming
+<http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming>`_ page in the Python Wiki for a
+much more complete list, and also for links to documents where the
+different GUI toolkits are compared.
