 :mod:`binhex` --- Encode and decode binhex4 files
 =================================================
 
 .. module:: binhex
    :synopsis: Encode and decode files in binhex4 format.
 
 
 This module encodes and decodes files in binhex4 format, a format allowing
 representation of Macintosh files in ASCII.  On the Macintosh, both forks of a
 file and the finder information are encoded (or decoded), on other platforms
 only the data fork is handled.
 
+.. warning::
+
+   In 3.0, special Macintosh support is removed.

 The :mod:`binhex` module defines the following functions:
 
 
 .. function:: binhex(input, output)
 
    Convert a binary file with filename *input* to binhex file *output*. The
    *output* parameter can either be a filename or a file-like object (any object
    supporting a :meth:`write` and :meth:`close` method).

 -----
 
 There is an alternative, more powerful interface to the coder and decoder, see
 the source for details.
 
 If you code or decode textfiles on non-Macintosh platforms they will still use

 As of this writing, :func:`hexbin` appears to not work in all cases.
