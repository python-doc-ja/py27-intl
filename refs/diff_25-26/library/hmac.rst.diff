 This module implements the HMAC algorithm as described by :rfc:`2104`.
 
 
 .. function:: new(key[, msg[, digestmod]])
 
    Return a new hmac object.  If *msg* is present, the method call ``update(msg)``
    is made. *digestmod* is the digest constructor or module for the HMAC object to
-   use. It defaults to  the ``hashlib.md5`` constructor.
