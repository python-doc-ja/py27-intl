 .. function:: collect([generation])
 
    With no arguments, run a full collection.  The optional argument *generation*
    may be an integer specifying which generation to collect (from 0 to 2).  A
    :exc:`ValueError` is raised if the generation number  is invalid. The number of
    unreachable objects found is returned.
 
    .. versionchanged:: 2.5
       The optional *generation* argument was added.
 
+   .. versionchanged:: 2.6
+      The free lists maintained for a number of builtin types are cleared
+      whenever a full collection or collection of the highest generation (2)
+      is run.  Not all items in some free lists may be freed due to the
+      particular implementation, in particular :class:`int` and :class:`float`.
