 The Very High Level Layer
 *************************
 
 The functions in this chapter will let you execute Python source code given in a
 file or a buffer, but they will not let you interact in a more detailed way with
 the interpreter.
 
 Several of these functions accept a start symbol from the grammar as a
 parameter.  The available start symbols are :const:`Py_eval_input`,
 :const:`Py_file_input`, and :const:`Py_single_input`.  These are described
 following the functions which accept them as parameters.
 
-Note also that several of these functions take :ctype:`FILE\*` parameters.  On
+Note also that several of these functions take :ctype:`FILE\*` parameters.  One
 particular issue which needs to be handled carefully is that the :ctype:`FILE`
 structure for different C libraries can be different and incompatible.  Under
 Windows (at least), it is possible for dynamically linked extensions to actually
 use different libraries, so care should be taken that :ctype:`FILE\*` parameters
 are only passed to these functions if it is certain that they were created by
 the same library that the Python runtime is using.
 
 
 .. cfunction:: int Py_Main(int argc, char **argv)
 
    The main program for the standard interpreter.  This is made available for
    programs which embed Python.  The *argc* and *argv* parameters should be
    prepared exactly as those which are passed to a C program's :cfunc:`main`
    function.  It is important to note that the argument list may be modified (but
    the contents of the strings pointed to by the argument list are not). The return
    value will be the integer passed to the :func:`sys.exit` function, ``1`` if the
    interpreter exits due to an exception, or ``2`` if the parameter list does not
    represent a valid Python command line.
 
+   Note that if an otherwise unhandled :exc:`SystemError` is raised, this
+   function will not return ``1``, but exit the process, as long as
+   ``Py_InspectFlag`` is not set.

 .. cfunction:: int PyRun_AnyFile(FILE *fp, const char *filename)
 
    This is a simplified interface to :cfunc:`PyRun_AnyFileExFlags` below, leaving
    *closeit* set to ``0`` and *flags* set to *NULL*.

 .. cfunction:: int PyRun_SimpleStringFlags(const char *command, PyCompilerFlags *flags)
 
    Executes the Python source code from *command* in the :mod:`__main__` module
    according to the *flags* argument. If :mod:`__main__` does not already exist, it
    is created.  Returns ``0`` on success or ``-1`` if an exception was raised.  If
    there was an error, there is no way to get the exception information. For the
    meaning of *flags*, see below.
