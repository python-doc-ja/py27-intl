   Documenting Python
 ######################
 
 
 The Python language has a substantial body of documentation, much of it
 contributed by various authors. The markup used for the Python documentation is
 `reStructuredText`_, developed by the `docutils`_ project, amended by custom
-directives and using a toolset named *Sphinx* to postprocess the HTML output.
+directives and using a toolset named `Sphinx`_ to postprocess the HTML output.
 
 This document describes the style guide for our documentation, the custom
 reStructuredText markup introduced to support Python documentation and how it
 should be used, as well as the Sphinx build system.

 If you're interested in contributing to Python's documentation, there's no need
 to write reStructuredText if you're not so inclined; plain text contributions
 are more than welcome as well.
