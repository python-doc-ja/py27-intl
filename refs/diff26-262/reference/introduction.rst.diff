 Python for .NET
    This implementation actually uses the CPython implementation, but is a managed
    .NET application and makes .NET libraries available.  It was created by Brian
    Lloyd.  For more information, see the `Python for .NET home page
    <http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net>`_.
 
 IronPython
    An alternate Python for .NET.  Unlike Python.NET, this is a complete Python
    implementation that generates IL, and compiles Python code directly to .NET
    assemblies.  It was created by Jim Hugunin, the original creator of Jython.  For

 PyPy
    An implementation of Python written in Python; even the bytecode interpreter is
    written in Python.  This is executed using CPython as the underlying
    interpreter.  One of the goals of the project is to encourage experimentation
    with the language itself by making it easier to modify the interpreter (since it
    is written in Python).  Additional information is available on `the PyPy
    project's home page <http://codespeak.net/pypy/>`_.
 
 Each of these implementations varies in some way from the language as documented
 in this manual, or introduces specific information beyond what's covered in the
 standard Python documentation.  Please refer to the implementation-specific
