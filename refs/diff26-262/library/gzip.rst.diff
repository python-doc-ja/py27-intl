 :mod:`gzip` --- Support for :program:`gzip` files
 =================================================
 
 .. module:: gzip
    :synopsis: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects.
 
 This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files just
 like the GNU programs :program:`gzip` and :program:`gunzip` would.
 
-The data compression is provided by the :mod:``zlib`` module.
+The data compression is provided by the :mod:`zlib` module.
 
 The :mod:`gzip` module provides the :class:`GzipFile` class which is modeled
 after Python's File Object. The :class:`GzipFile` class reads and writes
 :program:`gzip`\ -format files, automatically compressing or decompressing the
 data so that it looks like an ordinary file object.
 
 Note that additional file formats which can be decompressed by the
 :program:`gzip` and :program:`gunzip` programs, such  as those produced by
 :program:`compress` and :program:`pack`, are not supported by this module.
 
 For other archive formats, see the :mod:`bz2`, :mod:`zipfile`, and
 :mod:`tarfile` modules.
