   A year value will be handled as described under "Year 2000 (Y2K) issues" above.
   A ``-1`` argument as the daylight savings flag, passed to :func:`mktime` will
   usually result in the correct daylight savings state to be filled in.
 
   When a tuple with an incorrect length is passed to a function expecting a
   :class:`struct_time`, or having elements of the wrong type, a :exc:`TypeError`
   is raised.
 
   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      The time value sequence was changed from a tuple to a :class:`struct_time`, with
      the addition of attribute names for the fields.

 The module defines the following functions and data items:
 
 .. data:: accept2dyear
 
    Boolean value indicating whether two-digit year values will be accepted.  This
    is true by default, but will be set to false if the environment variable
    :envvar:`PYTHONY2K` has been set to a non-empty string.  It may also be modified
    at run time.
 
 
 .. data:: altzone
