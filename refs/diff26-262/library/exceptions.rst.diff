 :exc:`Exception` class and not :exc:`BaseException`.  More information on
 defining exceptions is available in the Python Tutorial under
 :ref:`tut-userexceptions`.
 
 The following exceptions are only used as base classes for other exceptions.
 
 
 .. exception:: BaseException
 
    The base class for all built-in exceptions.  It is not meant to be directly
    inherited by user-defined classes (for that use :exc:`Exception`).  If
    :func:`str` or :func:`unicode` is called on an instance of this class, the

+   representation of the argument(s) to the instance are returned or the empty
    string when there were no arguments.  All arguments are  stored in :attr:`args`
    as a tuple.

 .. exception:: Exception
 
    All built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions are derived from this class.  All
    user-defined exceptions should also be derived from this class.

 .. exception:: ValueError
 
    Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the
    right type but an inappropriate value, and the situation is not described by a
    more precise exception such as :exc:`IndexError`.
 
 
+.. exception:: VMSError
+
+   Only available on VMS.  Raised when a VMS-specific error occurs.

 .. exception:: WindowsError
 
    Raised when a Windows-specific error occurs or when the error number does not
    correspond to an :cdata:`errno` value.  The :attr:`winerror` and
    :attr:`strerror` values are created from the return values of the
    :cfunc:`GetLastError` and :cfunc:`FormatMessage` functions from the Windows
    Platform API. The :attr:`errno` value maps the :attr:`winerror` value to
    corresponding ``errno.h`` values. This is a subclass of :exc:`OSError`.
