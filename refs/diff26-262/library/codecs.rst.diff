 It defines the following functions:
 
 
 .. function:: register(search_function)
 
    Register a codec search function. Search functions are expected to take one
    argument, the encoding name in all lower case letters, and return a
    :class:`CodecInfo` object having the following attributes:
 
    * ``name`` The name of the encoding;
 
-   * ``encoder`` The stateless encoding function;
+   * ``encode`` The stateless encoding function;
 
-   * ``decoder`` The stateless decoding function;
+   * ``decode`` The stateless decoding function;
 
    * ``incrementalencoder`` An incremental encoder class or factory function;
 
    * ``incrementaldecoder`` An incremental decoder class or factory function;
 
    * ``streamwriter`` A stream writer class or factory function;
 
    * ``streamreader`` A stream reader class or factory function.
 
    The various functions or classes take the following arguments:
 
-   *encoder* and *decoder*: These must be functions or methods which have the same
+   *encode* and *decode*: These must be functions or methods which have the same
    interface as the :meth:`encode`/:meth:`decode` methods of Codec instances (see
    Codec Interface). The functions/methods are expected to work in a stateless
    mode.
 
    *incrementalencoder* and *incrementaldecoder*: These have to be factory
    functions providing the following interface:
 
    ``factory(errors='strict')``
 
    The factory functions must return objects providing the interfaces defined by
    the base classes :class:`IncrementalEncoder` and :class:`IncrementalDecoder`,
    respectively. Incremental codecs can maintain state.
