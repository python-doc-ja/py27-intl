 .. method:: FTP.size(filename)
 
    Request the size of the file named *filename* on the server.  On success, the
    size of the file is returned as an integer, otherwise ``None`` is returned.
    Note that the ``SIZE`` command is not  standardized, but is supported by many

+   "polite" way to close a connection, but it may raise an exception if the server
    responds with an error to the ``QUIT`` command.  This implies a call to the

    subsequent calls (see below).
 
 
 .. method:: FTP.close()
 
    Close the connection unilaterally.  This should not be applied to an already
    closed connection such as after a successful call to :meth:`quit`.  After this
    call the :class:`FTP` instance should not be used any more (after a call to
    :meth:`close` or :meth:`quit` you cannot reopen the connection by issuing
    another :meth:`login` method).
