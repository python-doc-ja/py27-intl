 .. function:: gnu_getopt(args, options[, long_options])
 
    This function works like :func:`getopt`, except that GNU style scanning mode is
    used by default. This means that option and non-option arguments may be
    intermixed. The :func:`getopt` function stops processing options as soon as a
    non-option argument is encountered.
 
    If the first character of the option string is '+', or if the environment
-   variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, then option processing stops as soon as a
-   non-option argument is encountered.

 .. exception:: GetoptError
 
    This is raised when an unrecognized option is found in the argument list or when
    an option requiring an argument is given none. The argument to the exception is
    a string indicating the cause of the error.  For long options, an argument given
    to an option which does not require one will also cause this exception to be
    raised.  The attributes :attr:`msg` and :attr:`opt` give the error message and
    related option; if there is no specific option to which the exception relates,
