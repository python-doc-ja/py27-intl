    single: tracebacks; in CGI scripts
 
 The :mod:`cgitb` module provides a special exception handler for Python scripts.
 (Its name is a bit misleading.  It was originally designed to display extensive
 traceback information in HTML for CGI scripts.  It was later generalized to also
 display this information in plain text.)  After this module is activated, if an
 uncaught exception occurs, a detailed, formatted report will be displayed.  The
 report includes a traceback showing excerpts of the source code for each level,
 as well as the values of the arguments and local variables to currently running
 functions, to help you debug the problem.  Optionally, you can save this
 information to a file instead of sending it to the browser.

+To enable this feature, simply add this to the top of your CGI script::
 
-   import cgitb; cgitb.enable()
+   import cgitb
+   cgitb.enable()
 
 The options to the :func:`enable` function control whether the report is
 displayed in the browser and whether the report is logged to a file for later
 analysis.
 
 
 .. function:: enable([display[, logdir[, context[, format]]]])
 
    .. index:: single: excepthook() (in module sys)
 
    This function causes the :mod:`cgitb` module to take over the interpreter's
    default handling for exceptions by setting the value of :attr:`sys.excepthook`.
