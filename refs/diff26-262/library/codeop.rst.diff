    ``'<input>'``. Returns ``None`` if *source* is *not* valid Python code, but is a
    prefix of valid Python code.
 
    If there is a problem with *source*, an exception will be raised.
    :exc:`SyntaxError` is raised if there is invalid Python syntax, and
    :exc:`OverflowError` or :exc:`ValueError` if there is an invalid literal.
 
    The *symbol* argument determines whether *source* is compiled as a statement
    (``'single'``, the default) or as an :term:`expression` (``'eval'``).  Any
    other value will cause :exc:`ValueError` to  be raised.

       It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a
       successful outcome before reaching the end of the source; in this case,
       trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error.  For example,
       a backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by arbitrary garbage.
       This will be fixed once the API for the parser is better.
 
 
 .. class:: Compile()
 
    Instances of this class have :meth:`__call__` methods identical in signature to
    the built-in function :func:`compile`, but with the difference that if the
    instance compiles program text containing a :mod:`__future__` statement, the
