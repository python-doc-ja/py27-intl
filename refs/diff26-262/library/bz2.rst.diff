    .. method:: readlines([size])
 
       Return a list of lines read. The optional *size* argument, if given, is an
       approximate bound on the total number of bytes in the lines returned.
 
 
    .. method:: xreadlines()
 
       For backward compatibility. :class:`BZ2File` objects now include the
       performance optimizations previously implemented in the :mod:`xreadlines`
       module.

+      .. deprecated:: 2.3
          This exists only for compatibility with the method by this name on
          :class:`file` objects, which is deprecated.  Use ``for line in file``
          instead.
 
 
    .. method:: seek(offset[, whence])
 
       Move to new file position. Argument *offset* is a byte count. Optional
       argument *whence* defaults to ``os.SEEK_SET`` or ``0`` (offset from start
       of file; offset should be ``>= 0``); other values are ``os.SEEK_CUR`` or
       ``1`` (move relative to current position; offset can be positive or
       negative), and ``os.SEEK_END`` or ``2`` (move relative to end of file;
