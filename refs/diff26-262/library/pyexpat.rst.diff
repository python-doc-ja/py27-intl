    This method can only be called before the :meth:`Parse` or :meth:`ParseFile`
    methods are called; calling it after either of those have been called causes
    :exc:`ExpatError` to be raised with the :attr:`code` attribute set to
    :const:`errors.XML_ERROR_CANT_CHANGE_FEATURE_ONCE_PARSING`.

 :class:`xmlparser` objects have the following attributes:
 
 
 .. attribute:: xmlparser.buffer_size
 
-   The size of the buffer used when :attr:`buffer_text` is true.  
-   A new buffer size can be set by assigning a new integer value

    When the size is changed, the buffer will be flushed.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.6
       The buffer size can now be changed.
 
 .. attribute:: xmlparser.buffer_text
 
    Setting this to true causes the :class:`xmlparser` object to buffer textual
    content returned by Expat to avoid multiple calls to the
    :meth:`CharacterDataHandler` callback whenever possible.  This can improve
