 **Optional in-place filtering:** if the keyword argument ``inplace=1`` is passed
 to :func:`fileinput.input` or to the :class:`FileInput` constructor, the file is
 moved to a backup file and standard output is directed to the input file (if a
 file of the same name as the backup file already exists, it will be replaced
 silently).  This makes it possible to write a filter that rewrites its input
 file in place.  If the *backup* parameter is given (typically as
 ``backup='.<some extension>'``), it specifies the extension for the backup file,
 and the backup file remains around; by default, the extension is ``'.bak'`` and
 it is deleted when the output file is closed.  In-place filtering is disabled
 when standard input is read.

    The current implementation does not work for MS-DOS 8+3 filesystems.
 
 
 The two following opening hooks are provided by this module:
 
 .. function:: hook_compressed(filename, mode)
 
    Transparently opens files compressed with gzip and bzip2 (recognized by the
    extensions ``'.gz'`` and ``'.bz2'``) using the :mod:`gzip` and :mod:`bz2`
    modules.  If the filename extension is not ``'.gz'`` or ``'.bz2'``, the file is
    opened normally (ie, using :func:`open` without any decompression).
