 parameters are named after the corresponding variables in the distribution's
 equation, as used in common mathematical practice; most of these equations can
 be found in any statistics text.
 
 
 .. function:: random()
 
    Return the next random floating point number in the range [0.0, 1.0).
 
 
 .. function:: uniform(a, b)
 
-   Return a random floating point number *N* such that ``a <= N < b`` for
-   ``a <= b`` and ``b <= N < a`` for ``b < a``.

-   Return a random floating point number *N* such that ``low <= N < high`` and
+   Return a random floating point number *N* such that ``low <= N <= high`` and
    with the specified *mode* between those bounds.  The *low* and *high* bounds
    default to zero and one.  The *mode* argument defaults to the midpoint
    between the bounds, giving a symmetric distribution.

-   Beta distribution.  Conditions on the parameters are ``alpha > 0`` and ``beta >
-   0``. Returned values range between 0 and 1.

-   Gaussian distribution.  *mu* is the mean, and *sigma* is the standard deviation.

    Log normal distribution.  If you take the natural logarithm of this
