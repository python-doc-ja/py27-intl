 :mod:`sgmllib` --- Simple SGML parser
 =====================================
 
 .. module:: sgmllib
    :synopsis: Only as much of an SGML parser as needed to parse HTML.
    :deprecated:
-   
+
 .. deprecated:: 2.6
     The :mod:`sgmllib` module has been removed in Python 3.0.
 
 .. index:: single: SGML
 
 This module defines a class :class:`SGMLParser` which serves as the basis for
 parsing text files formatted in SGML (Standard Generalized Mark-up Language).
 In fact, it does not provide a full SGML parser --- it only parses SGML insofar
 as it is used by HTML, and the module only exists as a base for the
 :mod:`htmllib` module.  Another HTML parser which supports XHTML and offers a
 somewhat different interface is available in the :mod:`HTMLParser` module.
