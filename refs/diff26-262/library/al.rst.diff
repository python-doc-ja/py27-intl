 :mod:`al` --- Audio functions on the SGI
 ========================================
 
 .. module:: al
    :platform: IRIX
    :synopsis: Audio functions on the SGI.
    :deprecated:
-   
+
 .. deprecated:: 2.6
     The :mod:`al` module has been deprecated for removal in Python 3.0.
 
 
 This module provides access to the audio facilities of the SGI Indy and Indigo
 workstations.  See section 3A of the IRIX man pages for details.  You'll need to
 read those man pages to understand what these functions do!  Some of the
 functions are not available in IRIX releases before 4.0.5.  Again, see the
 manual to check whether a specific function is available on your platform.
 
 All functions and methods defined in this module are equivalent to the C
 functions with ``AL`` prefixed to their name.
