    :class:`HTTP` class is retained only for backward compatibility with 1.5.2.  It
    should not be used in new code.  Refer to the online docstrings for usage.
 
 The module provides the following classes:
 
 
 .. class:: HTTPConnection(host[, port[, strict[, timeout]]])
 
    An :class:`HTTPConnection` instance represents one transaction with an HTTP
    server.  It should be instantiated passing it a host and optional port
    number.  If no port number is passed, the port is extracted from the host
    string if it has the form ``host:port``, else the default HTTP port (80) is
-   used.  When True, the optional parameter *strict* causes ``BadStatusLine`` to
+   used.  When True, the optional parameter *strict* (which defaults to a false
+   value) causes ``BadStatusLine`` to
    be raised if the status line can't be parsed as a valid HTTP/1.0 or 1.1
    status line.  If the optional *timeout* parameter is given, blocking
    operations (like connection attempts) will timeout after that many seconds
    (if it is not given, the global default timeout setting is used).
 
    For example, the following calls all create instances that connect to the server
    at the same host and port::
 
       >>> h1 = httplib.HTTPConnection('www.cwi.nl')
       >>> h2 = httplib.HTTPConnection('www.cwi.nl:80')
       >>> h3 = httplib.HTTPConnection('www.cwi.nl', 80)
       >>> h3 = httplib.HTTPConnection('www.cwi.nl', 80, timeout=10)
