    Return the 'thread identifier' of the current thread.  This is a nonzero
    integer.  Its value has no direct meaning; it is intended as a magic cookie to
    be used e.g. to index a dictionary of thread-specific data.  Thread identifiers
    may be recycled when a thread exits and another thread is created.
 
 
 .. function:: stack_size([size])
 
    Return the thread stack size used when creating new threads.  The optional
    *size* argument specifies the stack size to be used for subsequently created
    threads, and must be 0 (use platform or configured default) or a positive
    integer value of at least 32,768 (32kB). If changing the thread stack size is
-   unsupported, a :exc:`ThreadError` is raised.  If the specified stack size is
+   unsupported, the :exc:`error` exception is raised.  If the specified stack size is
    invalid, a :exc:`ValueError` is raised and the stack size is unmodified.  32kB
    is currently the minimum supported stack size value to guarantee sufficient
    stack space for the interpreter itself.  Note that some platforms may have
    particular restrictions on values for the stack size, such as requiring a
    minimum stack size > 32kB or requiring allocation in multiples of the system
    memory page size - platform documentation should be referred to for more
    information (4kB pages are common; using multiples of 4096 for the stack size is
    the suggested approach in the absence of more specific information).
    Availability: Windows, systems with POSIX threads.
