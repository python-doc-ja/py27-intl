       C++ toolkit.  It provides a native look and feel for applications on
       Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix systems by using each platform's native
       widgets where ever possible, (GTK+ on Unix-like systems).  In addition to
       an extensive set of widgets, wxPython provides classes for online
       documentation and context sensitive help, printing, HTML viewing,
       low-level device context drawing, drag and drop, system clipboard access,
       an XML-based resource format and more, including an ever growing library
       of user-contributed modules.  wxPython has a book, `wxPython in Action
       <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932394621>`_, by Noel Rappin and
       Robin Dunn.
 
 PyGTK, PyQt, and wxPython, all have a modern look and feel and more
-widgets than Tkinter. In addition, there are many other GUI toolkits for 
+widgets than Tkinter. In addition, there are many other GUI toolkits for
 Python, both cross-platform, and platform-specific. See the `GUI Programming
 <http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming>`_ page in the Python Wiki for a
 much more complete list, and also for links to documents where the
 different GUI toolkits are compared.
