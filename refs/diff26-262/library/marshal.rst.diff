 Not all Python object types are supported; in general, only objects whose value
 is independent from a particular invocation of Python can be written and read by
 this module.  The following types are supported: ``None``, integers, long
 integers, floating point numbers, strings, Unicode objects, tuples, lists, sets,
 dictionaries, and code objects, where it should be understood that tuples, lists
 and dictionaries are only supported as long as the values contained therein are
 themselves supported; and recursive lists and dictionaries should not be written
 (they will cause infinite loops).

    On machines where C's ``long int`` type has more than 32 bits (such as the
    DEC Alpha), it is possible to create plain Python integers that are longer
    than 32 bits. If such an integer is marshaled and read back in on a machine
    where C's ``long int`` type has only 32 bits, a Python long integer object
    is returned instead.  While of a different type, the numeric value is the
    same.  (This behavior is new in Python 2.2.  In earlier versions, all but the
    least-significant 32 bits of the value were lost, and a warning message was
    printed.)
 
 There are functions that read/write files as well as functions operating on
 strings.
