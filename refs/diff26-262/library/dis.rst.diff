 .. opcode:: CALL_FUNCTION (argc)
 
    Calls a function.  The low byte of *argc* indicates the number of positional
    parameters, the high byte the number of keyword parameters. On the stack, the
    opcode finds the keyword parameters first.  For each keyword argument, the value
    is on top of the key.  Below the keyword parameters, the positional parameters
    are on the stack, with the right-most parameter on top.  Below the parameters,

 .. opcode:: MAKE_FUNCTION (argc)
 
    Pushes a new function object on the stack.  TOS is the code associated with the
    function.  The function object is defined to have *argc* default parameters,
    which are found below TOS.
