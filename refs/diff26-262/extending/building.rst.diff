 With this :file:`setup.py`, and a file :file:`demo.c`, running ::
 
-   python setup.py build 
+   python setup.py build
 
 will compile :file:`demo.c`, and produce an extension module named ``demo`` in
 the :file:`build` directory. Depending on the system, the module file will end
 up in a subdirectory :file:`build/lib.system`, and may have a name like
 :file:`demo.so` or :file:`demo.pyd`.
 
 In the :file:`setup.py`, all execution is performed by calling the ``setup``
 function. This takes a variable number of keyword arguments, of which the
 example above uses only a subset. Specifically, the example specifies
 meta-information to build packages, and it specifies the contents of the
 package.  Normally, a package will contain of addition modules, like Python
 source modules, documentation, subpackages, etc. Please refer to the distutils
