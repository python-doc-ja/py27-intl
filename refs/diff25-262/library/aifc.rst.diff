 This module provides support for reading and writing AIFF and AIFF-C files.
 AIFF is Audio Interchange File Format, a format for storing digital audio
 samples in a file.  AIFF-C is a newer version of the format that includes the
 ability to compress the audio data.

 Audio files have a number of parameters that describe the audio data. The
 sampling rate or frame rate is the number of times per second the sound is
 sampled.  The number of channels indicate if the audio is mono, stereo, or
 quadro.  Each frame consists of one sample per channel.  The sample size is the
 size in bytes of each sample.  Thus a frame consists of
 *nchannels*\**samplesize* bytes, and a second's worth of audio consists of
 *nchannels*\**samplesize*\**framerate* bytes.
 
 For example, CD quality audio has a sample size of two bytes (16 bits), uses two
 channels (stereo) and has a frame rate of 44,100 frames/second.  This gives a
 frame size of 4 bytes (2\*2), and a second's worth occupies 2\*2\*44100 bytes
