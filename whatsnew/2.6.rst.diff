-* A new function added in Python 2.6.6, :cfunc:`PySys_SetArgvEx`, sets
-  the value of ``sys.argv`` and can optionally update ``sys.path`` to
-  include the directory containing the script named by ``sys.argv[0]``
-  depending on the value of an *updatepath* parameter.

-  This function was added to close a security hole for applications
-  that embed Python.  The old function, :cfunc:`PySys_SetArgv`, would
-  always update ``sys.path``, and sometimes it would add the current
-  directory.  This meant that, if you ran an application embedding
-  Python in a directory controlled by someone else, attackers could
-  put a Trojan-horse module in the directory (say, a file named
-  :file:`os.py`) that your application would then import and run.

-  If you maintain a C/C++ application that embeds Python, check
-  whether you're calling :cfunc:`PySys_SetArgv` and carefully consider
-  whether the application should be using :cfunc:`PySys_SetArgvEx`
-  with *updatepath* set to false.  Note that using this function will
-  break compatibility with Python versions 2.6.5 and earlier; if you
-  have to continue working with earlier versions, you can leave
-  the call to :cfunc:`PySys_SetArgv` alone and call
-  ``PyRun_SimpleString("sys.path.pop(0)\n")`` afterwards to discard
-  the first ``sys.path`` component.
