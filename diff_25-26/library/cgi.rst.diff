 This module defines a number of utilities for use by CGI scripts written in
 Python.
 
 
 Introduction
 ------------
 
 .. _cgi-intro:
 
 A CGI script is invoked by an HTTP server, usually to process user input
 submitted through an HTML ``<FORM>`` or ``<ISINDEX>`` element.

 The second section is usually HTML, which allows the client software to display
 nicely formatted text with header, in-line images, etc. Here's Python code that
 prints a simple piece of HTML::
 
    print "<TITLE>CGI script output</TITLE>"
    print "<H1>This is my first CGI script</H1>"

 Using the cgi module
 --------------------
 
-.. _using the cgi module:
-
 Begin by writing ``import cgi``.  Do not use ``from cgi import *`` --- the
 module defines all sorts of names for its own use or for backward compatibility
 that you don't want in your namespace.
 
 When you write a new script, consider adding the line::
 
    import cgitb; cgitb.enable()
 
 This activates a special exception handler that will display detailed reports in
 the Web browser if any errors occur.  If you'd rather not show the guts of your
 program to users of your script, you can have the reports saved to files
 instead, with a line like this::

 attribute.  You can then read the data at leisure from the :attr:`file`
 attribute::
 
    fileitem = form["userfile"]
    if fileitem.file:
        # It's an uploaded file; count lines
        linecount = 0
        while 1:
            line = fileitem.file.readline()
            if not line: break
            linecount = linecount + 1
 
+If an error is encountered when obtaining the contents of an uploaded file
+(for example, when the user interrupts the form submission by clicking on
+a Back or Cancel button) the :attr:`done` attribute of the object for the
+field will be set to the value -1.
+
 The file upload draft standard entertains the possibility of uploading multiple
 files from one field (using a recursive :mimetype:`multipart/\*` encoding).
 When this occurs, the item will be a dictionary-like :class:`FieldStorage` item.
 This can be determined by testing its :attr:`type` attribute, which should be
 :mimetype:`multipart/form-data` (or perhaps another MIME type matching
 :mimetype:`multipart/\*`).  In this case, it can be iterated over recursively
 just like the top-level form object.
 
 When a form is submitted in the "old" format (as the query string or as a single
 data part of type :mimetype:`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`), the items will
 actually be instances of the class :class:`MiniFieldStorage`.  In this case, the
 :attr:`list`, :attr:`file`, and :attr:`filename` attributes are always ``None``.
 
+A form submitted via POST that also has a query string will contain both
+:class:`FieldStorage` and :class:`MiniFieldStorage` items.
 
 Higher Level Interface
 ----------------------
 
 .. versionadded:: 2.2
 
 The previous section explains how to read CGI form data using the
 :class:`FieldStorage` class.  This section describes a higher level interface
 which was added to this class to allow one to do it in a more readable and
 intuitive way.  The interface doesn't make the techniques described in previous
 sections obsolete --- they are still useful to process file uploads efficiently,
 for example.
 
-.. % XXX: Is this true ?
+.. XXX: Is this true ?
 
 The interface consists of two simple methods. Using the methods you can process
 form data in a generic way, without the need to worry whether only one or more
 values were posted under one name.
 
 In the previous section, you learned to write following code anytime you
 expected a user to post more than one value under one name::
 
    item = form.getvalue("item")
    if isinstance(item, list):
        # The user is requesting more than one item.

 Using these methods you can write nice compact code::
 
    import cgi
    form = cgi.FieldStorage()

 :class:`SvFormContentDict` stores single value form content as dictionary; it
 assumes each field name occurs in the form only once.
 
 :class:`FormContentDict` stores multiple value form content as a dictionary (the
 form items are lists of values).  Useful if your form contains multiple fields
 with the same name.
 
 Other classes (:class:`FormContent`, :class:`InterpFormContentDict`) are present

 algorithms implemented in this module in other circumstances.

-   value indicates that blank values are to be ignored and treated as if they were
-   not included.
-
-   The optional argument *strict_parsing* is a flag indicating what to do with
-   parsing errors.  If false (the default), errors are silently ignored.  If true,

    Parse input of type :mimetype:`multipart/form-data` (for  file uploads).

    :class:`FieldStorage` class instead which is much more flexible.
 
    Note that this does not parse nested multipart parts --- use
    :class:`FieldStorage` for that.
 
 
 .. function:: parse_header(string)
 
    Parse a MIME header (such as :mailheader:`Content-Type`) into a main value and a
    dictionary of parameters.
