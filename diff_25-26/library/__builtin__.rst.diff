 :mod:`__builtin__` --- Built-in objects
 =======================================
 
 .. module:: __builtin__
    :synopsis: The module that provides the built-in namespace.
 
 
 This module provides direct access to all 'built-in' identifiers of Python; for
 example, ``__builtin__.open`` is the full name for the built-in function
-:func:`open`.  See chapter :ref:`builtin`, "Built-in Objects."
+:func:`open`.  See chapter :ref:`builtin`.
 
 This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most applications, but can be
 useful in modules that provide objects with the same name as a built-in value,
 but in which the built-in of that name is also needed.  For example, in a module
 that wants to implement an :func:`open` function that wraps the built-in
 :func:`open`, this module can be used directly::
 
    import __builtin__
 
    def open(path):
        f = __builtin__.open(path, 'r')
        return UpperCaser(f)
