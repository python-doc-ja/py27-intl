 :mod:`compileall` --- Byte-compile Python libraries
 ===================================================
 
 .. module:: compileall
    :synopsis: Tools for byte-compiling all Python source files in a directory tree.
 
 
 This module provides some utility functions to support installing Python
 libraries.  These functions compile Python source files in a directory tree,
 allowing users without permission to write to the libraries to take advantage of
 cached byte-code files.
 
-The source file for this module may also be used as a script to compile Python
-sources in directories named on the command line or in ``sys.path``.
+This module may also be used as a script (using the :option:`-m` Python flag) to
+compile Python sources.  Directories to recursively traverse (passing
+:option:`-l` stops the recursive behavior) for sources are listed on the command
+line.  If no arguments are given, the invocation is equivalent to ``-l
+sys.path``.  Printing lists of the files compiled can be disabled with the
+:option:`-q` flag.  In addition, the :option:`-x` option takes a regular
+expression argument.  All files that match the expression will be skipped.
 
 
 .. function:: compile_dir(dir[, maxlevels[, ddir[, force[,  rx[, quiet]]]]])
 
    Recursively descend the directory tree named by *dir*, compiling all :file:`.py`
    files along the way.  The *maxlevels* parameter is used to limit the depth of
    the recursion; it defaults to ``10``.  If *ddir* is given, it is used as the
    base path from  which the filenames used in error messages will be generated.
    If *force* is true, modules are re-compiled even if the timestamps are up to
    date.
 
    If *rx* is given, it specifies a regular expression of file names to exclude
