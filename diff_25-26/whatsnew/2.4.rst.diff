 This article explains the new features in Python 2.4.1, released on March 30,
 2005.
 
 Python 2.4 is a medium-sized release.  It doesn't introduce as many changes as
 the radical Python 2.2, but introduces more features than the conservative 2.3
 release.  The most significant new language features are function decorators and
 generator expressions; most other changes are to the standard library.
 
 According to the CVS change logs, there were 481 patches applied and 502 bugs
 fixed between Python 2.3 and 2.4.  Both figures are likely to be underestimates.
 
 This article doesn't attempt to provide a complete specification of every single
 new feature, but instead provides a brief introduction to each feature.  For
 full details, you should refer to the documentation for Python 2.4, such as the
-Python Library Reference (XXX reference: ../lib/lib.html) and the Python
-Reference Manual (XXX reference: ../ref/ref.html).  Often you will be referred

 PEP 218: Built-In Set Objects
 =============================
 
 Python 2.3 introduced the :mod:`sets` module.  C implementations of set data
 types have now been added to the Python core as two new built-in types,
 :func:`set(iterable)` and :func:`frozenset(iterable)`.  They provide high speed
 operations for membership testing, for eliminating duplicates from sequences,
 and for mathematical operations like unions, intersections, differences, and
 symmetric differences. ::

 PEP 237: Unifying Long Integers and Integers
 ============================================
 
 The lengthy transition process for this PEP, begun in Python 2.2, takes another
 step forward in Python 2.4.  In 2.3, certain integer operations that would
 behave differently after int/long unification triggered :exc:`FutureWarning`
 warnings and returned values limited to 32 or 64 bits (depending on your
 platform).  In 2.4, these expressions no longer produce a warning and instead
 produce a different result that's usually a long integer.
 
 The problematic expressions are primarily left shifts and lengthy hexadecimal
 and octal constants.  For example, ``2 << 32`` results in a warning in 2.3,
 evaluating to 0 on 32-bit platforms.  In Python 2.4, this expression now returns
 the correct answer, 8589934592.

 PEP 289: Generator Expressions
 ==============================
 
 The iterator feature introduced in Python 2.2 and the :mod:`itertools` module
 make it easier to write programs that loop through large data sets without
 having the entire data set in memory at one time.  List comprehensions don't fit
 into this picture very well because they produce a Python list object containing
 all of the items.  This unavoidably pulls all of the objects into memory, which
 can be a problem if your data set is very large.  When trying to write a
 functionally-styled program, it would be natural to write something like::

 Most notably, the loop variable (*obj* in the above example) is not accessible

 list comprehensions match generator expressions in this respect.

 PEP 292: Simpler String Substitutions
 =====================================
 
 Some new classes in the standard library provide an alternative mechanism for
 substituting variables into strings; this style of substitution may be better
 for applications where untrained users need to edit templates.
 
 The usual way of substituting variables by name is the ``%`` operator::

 PEP 318: Decorators for Functions and Methods
 =============================================
 
 Python 2.2 extended Python's object model by adding static methods and class
 methods, but it didn't extend Python's syntax to provide any new way of defining
 static or class methods.  Instead, you had to write a :keyword:`def` statement
 in the usual way, and pass the resulting method to a :func:`staticmethod` or
 :func:`classmethod` function that would wrap up the function as a method of the
 new type. Your code would look like this::

 The standard library provides a number of ways to execute a subprocess, offering
 different features and different levels of complexity.
 :func:`os.system(command)` is easy to use, but slow (it runs a shell process
 which executes the command) and dangerous (you have to be careful about escaping
 the shell's metacharacters).  The :mod:`popen2` module offers classes that can
 capture standard output and standard error from the subprocess, but the naming
 is confusing.  The :mod:`subprocess` module cleans  this up, providing a unified

 PEP 327: Decimal Data Type

 Python has always supported floating-point (FP) numbers, based on the underlying
 C :ctype:`double` type, as a data type.  However, while most programming
 languages provide a floating-point type, many people (even programmers) are
 unaware that floating-point numbers don't represent certain decimal fractions
 accurately.  The new :class:`Decimal` type can represent these fractions
 accurately, up to a user-specified precision limit.

 PEP 328: Multi-line Imports

 One language change is a small syntactic tweak aimed at making it easier to
 import many names from a module.  In a ``from module import names`` statement,
 *names* is a sequence of names separated by commas.  If the sequence is  very
 long, you can either write multiple imports from the same module, or you can use
 backslashes to escape the line endings like this::

 PEP was not implemented for Python 2.4, but was completed for Python 2.5.

 PEP 331: Locale-Independent Float/String Conversions
 ====================================================
 
 The :mod:`locale` modules lets Python software select various conversions and
 display conventions that are localized to a particular country or language.
 However, the module was careful to not change the numeric locale because various
 functions in Python's implementation required that the numeric locale remain set
 to the ``'C'`` locale.  Often this was because the code was using the C
 library's :cfunc:`atof` function.

 The solution described in the PEP is to add three new functions to the Python
 API that perform ASCII-only conversions, ignoring the locale setting:
 
 * :cfunc:`PyOS_ascii_strtod(str, ptr)`  and :cfunc:`PyOS_ascii_atof(str, ptr)`
   both convert a string to a C :ctype:`double`.

 Optimizations
 -------------
 
 * The inner loops for list and tuple slicing were optimized and now run about
   one-third faster.  The inner loops for dictionaries were also optimized,
   resulting in performance boosts for :meth:`keys`, :meth:`values`, :meth:`items`,
   :meth:`iterkeys`, :meth:`itervalues`, and :meth:`iteritems`. (Contributed by

   you shouldn't rely on it; using the :meth:`join` method of strings is still
   recommended when you want to efficiently glue a large number of strings
   together. (Contributed by Armin Rigo.)
 
 The net result of the 2.4 optimizations is that Python 2.4 runs the pystone
 benchmark around 5% faster than Python 2.3 and 35% faster than Python 2.2.
 (pystone is not a particularly good benchmark, but it's the most commonly used
 measurement of Python's performance.  Your own applications may show greater or
 smaller benefits from Python 2.4.)

   Note that :func:`tee` has to keep copies of the values returned  by the

   trailing iterator in a long stream of inputs. If the separation is large, then
   you might as well use  :func:`list` instead.  When the iterators track closely

 cookielib
 ---------
 
 The :mod:`cookielib` library supports client-side handling for HTTP cookies,
 mirroring the :mod:`Cookie` module's server-side cookie support. Cookies are
 stored in cookie jars; the library transparently stores cookies offered by the
 web server in the cookie jar, and fetches the cookie from the jar when
 connecting to the server. As in web browsers, policy objects control whether
 cookies are accepted or not.
 
 In order to store cookies across sessions, two implementations of cookie jars
 are provided: one that stores cookies in the Netscape format so applications can
 use the Mozilla or Lynx cookie files, and one that stores cookies in the same
 format as the Perl libwww library.
 
 :mod:`urllib2` has been changed to interact with :mod:`cookielib`:
 :class:`HTTPCookieProcessor` manages a cookie jar that is used when accessing
 URLs.
