 Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient
 high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
 object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
 together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting
 and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
 
 The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available

 Reference document. The Python Reference Manual gives a more formal definition
 of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and Embedding
 the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference. There are also several books
 covering Python in depth.
 
 This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single
 feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of
 Python's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the
 language's flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and
 write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the
 various Python library modules described in the Python Library Reference.
 
+The :ref:`glossary` is also worth going through.
