 Obviously, supplying even a few of these options on the command-line would be
 tedious and error-prone, so it's usually best to put them in the setup
 configuration file, :file:`setup.cfg`\ ---see section :ref:`setup-config`.  If
 you distribute or package many Python module distributions, you might want to
 put options that apply to all of them in your personal Distutils configuration

 There are three steps to building a binary RPM package, all of which are
 handled automatically by the Distutils:
 
 #. create a :file:`.spec` file, which describes the package (analogous  to the
    Distutils setup script; in fact, much of the information in the  setup script
    winds up in the :file:`.spec` file)

    on whether your module distribution contains Python extensions)
