 Distutils can be extended in various ways.  Most extensions take the form of new
 commands or replacements for existing commands.  New commands may be written to
 support new types of platform-specific packaging, for example, while
 replacements for existing commands may be made to modify details of how the
 command operates on a package.
 
 Most extensions of the distutils are made within :file:`setup.py` scripts that
 want to modify existing commands; many simply add a few file extensions that
 should be copied into packages in addition to :file:`.py` files as a
 convenience.
