    python setup.py sdist bdist_wininst upload
 
 will cause the source distribution and the Windows installer to be uploaded to
 PyPI.  Note that these will be uploaded even if they are built using an earlier
 invocation of :file:`setup.py`, but that only distributions named on the command
 line for the invocation including the :command:`upload` command are uploaded.
 
 The :command:`upload` command uses the username, password, and repository URL
 from the :file:`$HOME/.pypirc` file (see section :ref:`pypirc` for more on this
 file).
 
+You can specify another PyPI server with the :option:`--repository=*url*` option::
+
+   python setup.py sdist bdist_wininst upload -r http://example.com/pypi
+
+See section :ref:`pypirc` for more on defining several servers.
+
 You can use the :option:`--sign` option to tell :command:`upload` to sign each
 uploaded file using GPG (GNU Privacy Guard).  The  :program:`gpg` program must
 be available for execution on the system :envvar:`PATH`.  You can also specify
 which key to use for signing using the :option:`--identity=*name*` option.
 
-Other :command:`upload` options include  :option:`--repository=*url*` (which
-lets you override the repository setting from :file:`$HOME/.pypirc`), and
+Other :command:`upload` options include :option:`--repository=<url>` or
+:option:`--repository=<section>` where *url* is the url of the server and
+*section* the name of the section in :file:`$HOME/.pypirc`, and
 :option:`--show-response` (which displays the full response text from the PyPI
 server for help in debugging upload problems).
