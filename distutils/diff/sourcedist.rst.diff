 Specifying the files to distribute
 ==================================
 
 If you don't supply an explicit list of files (or instructions on how to
 generate one), the :command:`sdist` command puts a minimal default set into the
 source distribution:
 
 * all Python source files implied by the :option:`py_modules` and
   :option:`packages` options
 
 * all C source files mentioned in the :option:`ext_modules` or
-  :option:`libraries` options (
+  :option:`libraries` options
 
-  **\*\*** getting C library sources currently broken---no
-  :meth:`get_source_files` method in :file:`build_clib.py`! **\*\***)
+  .. XXX Getting C library sources is currently broken -- no
+     :meth:`get_source_files` method in :file:`build_clib.py`!
 
 * scripts identified by the :option:`scripts` option
 
 * anything that looks like a test script: :file:`test/test\*.py` (currently, the
   Distutils don't do anything with test scripts except include them in source
   distributions, but in the future there will be a standard for testing Python
   module distributions)
 
 * :file:`README.txt` (or :file:`README`), :file:`setup.py` (or whatever  you
   called your setup script), and :file:`setup.cfg`
 
 Sometimes this is enough, but usually you will want to specify additional files

 * if either :file:`MANIFEST.in` or the setup script (:file:`setup.py`) are more
   recent than :file:`MANIFEST`, recreate :file:`MANIFEST` by reading
   :file:`MANIFEST.in`
 
 * use the list of files now in :file:`MANIFEST` (either just generated or read
   in) to create the source distribution archive(s)
 
 There are a couple of options that modify this behaviour.  First, use the
 :option:`--no-defaults` and :option:`--no-prune` to disable the standard
 "include" and "exclude" sets.
