+As shown in section :ref:`distutils-simple-example`, you use the :command:`sdist` command
 to create a source distribution.  In the simplest case, ::
 
    python setup.py sdist
 
 (assuming you haven't specified any :command:`sdist` options in the setup script
 or config file), :command:`sdist` creates the archive of the default format for
 the current platform.  The default format is a gzip'ed tar file
 (:file:`.tar.gz`) on Unix, and ZIP file on Windows.
 
 You can specify as many formats as you like using the :option:`--formats`
 option, for example::

 :option:`--no-defaults` option to disable the standard set entirely.)  There are
 several other commands available in the manifest template mini-language; see
 section :ref:`sdist-cmd`.
 
 The order of commands in the manifest template matters: initially, we have the
 list of default files as described above, and each command in the template adds
 to or removes from that list of files.  Once we have fully processed the
 manifest template, we remove files that should not be included in the source
 distribution:
 
 * all files in the Distutils "build" tree (default :file:`build/`)
 
-* all files in directories named :file:`RCS`, :file:`CVS` or :file:`.svn`
+* all files in directories named :file:`RCS`, :file:`CVS`, :file:`.svn`,
+  :file:`.hg`, :file:`.git`, :file:`.bzr` or :file:`_darcs`
 
 Now we have our complete list of files, which is written to the manifest for
 future reference, and then used to build the source distribution archive(s).
 
 You can disable the default set of included files with the
 :option:`--no-defaults` option, and you can disable the standard exclude set
 with :option:`--no-prune`.
 
 Following the Distutils' own manifest template, let's trace how the
 :command:`sdist` command builds the list of files to include in the Distutils
 source distribution:

 Just like in the setup script, file and directory names in the manifest template
 should always be slash-separated; the Distutils will take care of converting
 them to the standard representation on your platform. That way, the manifest
 template is portable across operating systems.
