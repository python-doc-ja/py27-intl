       the object named *b* in the class dictionary for *a*, but if *b* is a

    hashable
       An object is *hashable* if it has a hash value which never changes during

       other objects (it needs an :meth:`__eq__` or :meth:`__cmp__` method).
       Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.
 
       Hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set member,
       because these data structures use the hash value internally.
 
       All of Python&#39;s immutable built-in objects are hashable, while no mutable
       containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are.  Objects which are
       instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default; they all
       compare unequal, and their hash value is their :func:`id`.

    keyword argument
       Arguments which are preceded with a ``variable_name=`` in the call.
       The variable name designates the local name in the function to which the
       value is assigned.  ``**`` is used to accept or pass a dictionary of
       keyword arguments.  See :term:`argument`.
 
    lambda
       An anonymous inline function consisting of a single :term:`expression`
       which is evaluated when the function is called.  The syntax to create
       a lambda function is ``lambda [arguments]: expression``

       even hex numbers (0x..) in the range from 0 to 255. The :keyword:`if`
       clause is optional.  If omitted, all elements in ``range(256)`` are
       processed.
 
    loader
       An object that loads a module. It must define a method named
       :meth:`load_module`. A loader is typically returned by a
       :term:`finder`. See :pep:`302` for details.

    metaclass
       The class of a class.  Class definitions create a class name, a class
       dictionary, and a list of base classes.  The metaclass is responsible for
       taking those three arguments and creating the class.  Most object oriented
       programming languages provide a default implementation.  What makes Python
       special is that it is possible to create custom metaclasses.  Most users
       never need this tool, but when the need arises, metaclasses can provide
       powerful, elegant solutions.  They have been used for logging attribute
       access, adding thread-safety, tracking object creation, implementing
       singletons, and many other tasks.

       not available with single-quoted strings, they are useful for a number
       of reasons.  They allow you to include unescaped single and double
       quotes within a string and they can span multiple lines without the
       use of the continuation character, making them especially useful when
       writing docstrings.
 
    type
       The type of a Python object determines what kind of object it is; every
       object has a type.  An object&#39;s type is accessible as its
       :attr:`__class__` attribute or can be retrieved with ``type(obj)``.
