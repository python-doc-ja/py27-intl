 Your best way to get started with Python on Mac OS X is through the IDLE
 integrated development environment, see section :ref:`ide` and use the Help menu
 when the IDE is running.
 
 If you want to run Python scripts from the Terminal window command line or from
 the Finder you first need an editor to create your script. Mac OS X comes with a
 number of standard Unix command line editors, :program:`vim` and
 :program:`emacs` among them. If you want a more Mac-like editor,
 :program:`BBEdit` or :program:`TextWrangler` from Bare Bones Software (see
 http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml) are good choices, as is
 :program:`TextMate` (see http://macromates.com/). Other editors include
 :program:`Gvim` (http://macvim.org) and :program:`Aquamacs`
-(http://aquamacs.org).
+(http://aquamacs.org/).
 
 To run your script from the Terminal window you must make sure that
 :file:`/usr/local/bin` is in your shell search path.
 
 To run your script from the Finder you have two options:
 
 * Drag it to :program:`PythonLauncher`
 
 * Select :program:`PythonLauncher` as the default application to open your
   script (or any .py script) through the finder Info window and double-click it.
   :program:`PythonLauncher` has various preferences to control how your script is
   launched. Option-dragging allows you to change these for one invocation, or use

 The standard Python GUI toolkit is :mod:`Tkinter`, based on the cross-platform
 Tk toolkit (http://www.tcl.tk). An Aqua-native version of Tk is bundled with OS
 X by Apple, and the latest version can be downloaded and installed from
 http://www.activestate.com; it can also be built from source.

 Distributing Python Applications on the Mac
 ===========================================
 
 The "Build Applet" tool that is placed in the MacPython 2.5 folder is fine for
 packaging small Python scripts on your own machine to run as a standard Mac
 application. This tool, however, is not robust enough to distribute Python
 applications to other users.
 
 The standard tool for deploying standalone Python applications on the Mac is
 :program:`py2app`. More information on installing and using py2app can be found
