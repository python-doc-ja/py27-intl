"The modules described in this chapter support storing Python data in a "
"persistent form on disk.  The :mod:`pickle` and :mod:`marshal` modules can "
"turn many Python data types into a stream of bytes and then recreate the "
"objects from the bytes.  The various DBM-related modules support a family of"
" hash-based file formats that store a mapping of strings to other strings.  "
"The :mod:`bsddb` module also provides such disk-based string-to-string "
"mappings based on hashing, and also supports B-Tree and record-based "
"formats."
