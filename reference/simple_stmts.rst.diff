 So if you execute ``from . import mod`` from a module in the ``pkg`` package
 then you will end up importing ``pkg.mod``. If you execute ``from ..subpkg2

+import mod`` from within ``pkg.subpkg1`` you will import ``pkg.subpkg2.mod``.
 The specification for relative imports is contained within :pep:`328`.
