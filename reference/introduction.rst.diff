    This implementation actually uses the CPython implementation, but is a managed
    .NET application and makes .NET libraries available.  It was created by Brian
    Lloyd.  For more information, see the `Python for .NET home page
    <http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net>`_.
 
 IronPython
    An alternate Python for .NET.  Unlike Python.NET, this is a complete Python
    implementation that generates IL, and compiles Python code directly to .NET
    assemblies.  It was created by Jim Hugunin, the original creator of Jython.  For
    more information, see `the IronPython website <http://www.ironpython.com/>`_.
 
 PyPy
-   An implementation of Python written in Python; even the bytecode interpreter is
-   written in Python.  This is executed using CPython as the underlying
-   interpreter.  One of the goals of the project is to encourage experimentation
-   with the language itself by making it easier to modify the interpreter (since it
-   is written in Python).  Additional information is available on `the PyPy
-   project's home page <http://codespeak.net/pypy/>`_.
+   An implementation of Python written completely in Python. It supports several
+   advanced features not found in other implementations like stackless support
+   and a Just in Time compiler. One of the goals of the project is to encourage

 Each of these implementations varies in some way from the language as documented
 in this manual, or introduces specific information beyond what's covered in the
 standard Python documentation.  Please refer to the implementation-specific
 documentation to determine what else you need to know about the specific
 implementation you're using.
