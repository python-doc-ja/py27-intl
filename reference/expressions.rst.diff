 .. index:: single: atom
 
 Atoms are the most basic elements of expressions.  The simplest atoms are
 identifiers or literals.  Forms enclosed in reverse quotes or in parentheses,
 brackets or braces are also categorized syntactically as atoms.  The syntax for
 atoms is:
 
 .. productionlist::
    atom: `identifier` | `literal` | `enclosure`
    enclosure: `parenth_form` | `list_display`

 A list display yields a new list object.  Its contents are specified by
 providing either a list of expressions or a list comprehension.  When a
 comma-separated list of expressions is supplied, its elements are evaluated from
 left to right and placed into the list object in that order.  When a list
 comprehension is supplied, it consists of a single expression followed by at
 least one :keyword:`for` clause and zero or more :keyword:`for` or :keyword:`if`
 clauses.  In this case, the elements of the new list are those that would be
 produced by considering each of the :keyword:`for` or :keyword:`if` clauses a
 block, nesting from left to right, and evaluating the expression to produce a
 list element each time the innermost block is reached [#]_.

+
+Displays for sets and dictionaries
+----------------------------------
+
+For constructing a set or a dictionary Python provides special syntax
+called "displays", each of them in two flavors:
+
+* either the container contents are listed explicitly, or
+
+* they are computed via a set of looping and filtering instructions, called a
+  :dfn:`comprehension`.
+
+Common syntax elements for comprehensions are:
+
+.. productionlist::
+   comprehension: `expression` `comp_for`
+   comp_for: "for" `target_list` "in" `or_test` [`comp_iter`]
+   comp_iter: `comp_for` | `comp_if`
+   comp_if: "if" `expression_nocond` [`comp_iter`]
+
+The comprehension consists of a single expression followed by at least one
+:keyword:`for` clause and zero or more :keyword:`for` or :keyword:`if` clauses.
+In this case, the elements of the new container are those that would be produced
+by considering each of the :keyword:`for` or :keyword:`if` clauses a block,
+nesting from left to right, and evaluating the expression to produce an element
+each time the innermost block is reached.
+
+Note that the comprehension is executed in a separate scope, so names assigned
+to in the target list don't "leak" in the enclosing scope.

 Generator expressions
 ---------------------
 
 .. index:: pair: generator; expression
+           object: generator
 
 A generator expression is a compact generator notation in parentheses:
 
 .. productionlist::
-   generator_expression: "(" `expression` `genexpr_for` ")"
-   genexpr_for: "for" `target_list` "in" `or_test` [`genexpr_iter`]
-   genexpr_iter: `genexpr_for` | `genexpr_if`
-   genexpr_if: "if" `old_expression` [`genexpr_iter`]
+   generator_expression: "(" `expression` `comp_for` ")"
 
-.. index:: object: generator
+A generator expression yields a new generator object.  Its syntax is the same as
+for comprehensions, except that it is enclosed in parentheses instead of
+brackets or curly braces.
 
-A generator expression yields a new generator object.  It consists of a single
-expression followed by at least one :keyword:`for` clause and zero or more

-for each iteration.
+Variables used in the generator expression are evaluated lazily when the
+:meth:`__next__` method is called for generator object (in the same fashion as
+normal generators).  However, the leftmost :keyword:`for` clause is immediately
+evaluated, so that an error produced by it can be seen before any other possible
+error in the code that handles the generator expression.  Subsequent
+:keyword:`for` clauses cannot be evaluated immediately since they may depend on
+the previous :keyword:`for` loop. For example: ``(x*y for x in range(10) for y
+in bar(x))``.

 Dictionary displays

-   single: key
-   single: datum
-   single: key/datum pair
+           key, datum, key/datum pair
+           object: dictionary
 
 A dictionary display is a possibly empty series of key/datum pairs enclosed in
 curly braces:
 
 .. productionlist::
-   dict_display: "{" [`key_datum_list`] "}"
+   dict_display: "{" [`key_datum_list` | `dict_comprehension`] "}"
    key_datum_list: `key_datum` ("," `key_datum`)* [","]
    key_datum: `expression` ":" `expression`
-
-.. index:: object: dictionary
+   dict_comprehension: `expression` ":" `expression` `comp_for`
 
 A dictionary display yields a new dictionary object.
 
-The key/datum pairs are evaluated from left to right to define the entries of
-the dictionary: each key object is used as a key into the dictionary to store
-the corresponding datum.
+If a comma-separated sequence of key/datum pairs is given, they are evaluated
+from left to right to define the entries of the dictionary: each key object is
+used as a key into the dictionary to store the corresponding datum.  This means
+that you can specify the same key multiple times in the key/datum list, and the
+final dictionary's value for that key will be the last one given.
+
+A dict comprehension, in contrast to list and set comprehensions, needs two
+expressions separated with a colon followed by the usual "for" and "if" clauses.
+When the comprehension is run, the resulting key and value elements are inserted
+in the new dictionary in the order they are produced.
 
 .. index:: pair: immutable; object
+           hashable
 
 Restrictions on the types of the key values are listed earlier in section
 :ref:`types`.  (To summarize, the key type should be :term:`hashable`, which excludes
 all mutable objects.)  Clashes between duplicate keys are not detected; the last
 datum (textually rightmost in the display) stored for a given key value
 prevails.
 
 
+.. _set:
+
+Set displays
+------------
+
+.. index:: pair: set; display
+           object: set
+
+A set display is denoted by curly braces and distinguishable from dictionary
+displays by the lack of colons separating keys and values:
+
+.. productionlist::
+   set_display: "{" (`expression_list` | `comprehension`) "}"
+
+A set display yields a new mutable set object, the contents being specified by
+either a sequence of expressions or a comprehension.  When a comma-separated
+list of expressions is supplied, its elements are evaluated from left to right
+and added to the set object.  When a comprehension is supplied, the set is
+constructed from the elements resulting from the comprehension.
+
+An empty set cannot be constructed with ``{}``; this literal constructs an empty
+dictionary.
