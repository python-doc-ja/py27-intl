 Part of the trouble with understanding these things is that "socket" can mean a
 number of subtly different things, depending on context. So first, let's make a
 distinction between a "client" socket - an endpoint of a conversation, and a
 "server" socket, which is more like a switchboard operator. The client
 application (your browser, for example) uses "client" sockets exclusively; the
 web server it's talking to uses both "server" sockets and "client" sockets.

 They were invented in Berkeley as part of the BSD flavor of Unix. They spread
 like wildfire with the Internet. With good reason --- the combination of sockets
 with INET makes talking to arbitrary machines around the world unbelievably easy
 (at least compared to other schemes).
 
 
 Creating a Socket
 =================
 
 Roughly speaking, when you clicked on the link that brought you to this page,
 your browser did something like the following::
 
    #create an INET, STREAMing socket
    s = socket.socket(
        socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    #now connect to the web server on port 80
    # - the normal http port
    s.connect(("www.mcmillan-inc.com", 80))
 
-When the ``connect`` completes, the socket ``s`` can now be used to send in a
-request for the text of this page. The same socket will read the reply, and then
-be destroyed. That's right - destroyed. Client sockets are normally only used
-for one exchange (or a small set of sequential exchanges).

    #create an INET, STREAMing socket
    serversocket = socket.socket(
        socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    #bind the socket to a public host,
    # and a well-known port
    serversocket.bind((socket.gethostname(), 80))
    #become a server socket
    serversocket.listen(5)
 
 A couple things to notice: we used ``socket.gethostname()`` so that the socket
 would be visible to the outside world. If we had used ``s.bind(('', 80))`` or
 ``s.bind(('localhost', 80))`` or ``s.bind(('127.0.0.1', 80))`` we would still
 have a "server" socket, but one that was only visible within the same machine.
 
 A second thing to note: low number ports are usually reserved for "well known"
 services (HTTP, SNMP etc). If you're playing around, use a nice high number (4
 digits).
 
 Finally, the argument to ``listen`` tells the socket library that we want it to
 queue up as many as 5 connect requests (the normal max) before refusing outside
 connections. If the rest of the code is written properly, that should be plenty.
 
-OK, now we have a "server" socket, listening on port 80. Now we enter the

 Using a Socket
 ==============
 
 The first thing to note, is that the web browser's "client" socket and the web
 server's "client" socket are identical beasts. That is, this is a "peer to peer"
 conversation. Or to put it another way, *as the designer, you will have to
 decide what the rules of etiquette are for a conversation*. Normally, the
 ``connect``\ ing socket starts the conversation, by sending in a request, or
 perhaps a signon. But that's a design decision - it's not a rule of sockets.
 
 Now there are two sets of verbs to use for communication. You can use ``send``
 and ``recv``, or you can transform your client socket into a file-like beast and

+use ``read`` and ``write``. The latter is the way Java presents its sockets.
 I'm not going to talk about it here, except to warn you that you need to use
 ``flush`` on sockets. These are buffered "files", and a common mistake is to
 ``write`` something, and then ``read`` for a reply. Without a ``flush`` in
 there, you may wait forever for the reply, because the request may still be in
 your output buffer.
 
 Now we come the major stumbling block of sockets - ``send`` and ``recv`` operate
 on the network buffers. They do not necessarily handle all the bytes you hand
 them (or expect from them), because their major focus is handling the network
 buffers. In general, they return when the associated network buffers have been
 filled (``send``) or emptied (``recv``). They then tell you how many bytes they
 handled. It is *your* responsibility to call them again until your message has
 been completely dealt with.
 
 When a ``recv`` returns 0 bytes, it means the other side has closed (or is in
 the process of closing) the connection.  You will not receive any more data on
 this connection. Ever.  You may be able to send data successfully; I'll talk
 about that some on the next page.
 
 A protocol like HTTP uses a socket for only one transfer. The client sends a

 ``send`` or ``recv`` returns after handling 0 bytes, the connection has been
 broken.  If the connection has *not* been broken, you may wait on a ``recv``
 forever, because the socket will *not* tell you that there's nothing more to
 read (for now).  Now if you think about that a bit, you'll come to realize a
 fundamental truth of sockets: *messages must either be fixed length* (yuck), *or
 be delimited* (shrug), *or indicate how long they are* (much better), *or end by
 shutting down the connection*. The choice is entirely yours, (but some ways are
 righter than others).

 doing something dumb, like holding a lock while doing a blocking read, the
 thread isn't really consuming much in the way of resources. Do *not* try to kill
 the thread - part of the reason that threads are more efficient than processes
 is that they avoid the overhead associated with the automatic recycling of
 resources. In other words, if you do manage to kill the thread, your whole
 process is likely to be screwed up.
 
 
 Non-blocking Sockets
 ====================

+If you've understood the preceding, you already know most of what you need to
 know about the mechanics of using sockets. You'll still use the same calls, in
 much the same ways. It's just that, if you do it right, your app will be almost
 inside-out.
 
 In Python, you use ``socket.setblocking(0)`` to make it non-blocking. In C, it's
 more complex, (for one thing, you'll need to choose between the BSD flavor
 ``O_NONBLOCK`` and the almost indistinguishable Posix flavor ``O_NDELAY``, which
 is completely different from ``TCP_NODELAY``), but it's the exact same idea. You
 do this after creating the socket, but before using it. (Actually, if you're
 nuts, you can switch back and forth.)
 
 The major mechanical difference is that ``send``, ``recv``, ``connect`` and
 ``accept`` can return without having done anything. You have (of course) a
 number of choices. You can check return code and error codes and generally drive
 yourself crazy. If you don't believe me, try it sometime. Your app will grow
 large, buggy and suck CPU. So let's skip the brain-dead solutions and do it
 right.
 
 Use ``select``.
 
 In C, coding ``select`` is fairly complex. In Python, it's a piece of cake, but
 it's close enough to the C version that if you understand ``select`` in Python,
-you'll have little trouble with it in C. ::

    ready_to_read, ready_to_write, in_error = \

                      potential_errs,
                      timeout)
 
 You pass ``select`` three lists: the first contains all sockets that you might
 want to try reading; the second all the sockets you might want to try writing
 to, and the last (normally left empty) those that you want to check for errors.
 You should note that a socket can go into more than one list. The ``select``
 call is blocking, but you can give it a timeout. This is generally a sensible
 thing to do - give it a nice long timeout (say a minute) unless you have good
 reason to do otherwise.

 If a socket is in the output readable list, you can be
 as-close-to-certain-as-we-ever-get-in-this-business that a ``recv`` on that
 socket will return *something*. Same idea for the writable list. You'll be able
 to send *something*. Maybe not all you want to, but *something* is better than
 nothing.  (Actually, any reasonably healthy socket will return as writable - it
 just means outbound network buffer space is available.)
 
 If you have a "server" socket, put it in the potential_readers list. If it comes
 out in the readable list, your ``accept`` will (almost certainly) work. If you
 have created a new socket to ``connect`` to someone else, put it in the
 potential_writers list. If it shows up in the writable list, you have a decent
