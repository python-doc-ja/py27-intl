 Only the ``x++`` statement is executed if the condition is true, but the
 indentation leads you to believe otherwise.  Even experienced C programmers will
 sometimes stare at it a long time wondering why ``y`` is being decremented even
 for ``x > y``.
 
 Because there are no begin/end brackets, Python is much less prone to
 coding-style conflicts.  In C there are many different ways to place the braces.
 If you're used to reading and writing code that uses one style, you will feel at
 least slightly uneasy when reading (or being required to write) another style.

+Many coding styles place begin/end brackets on a line by themselves.  This makes
 programs considerably longer and wastes valuable screen space, making it harder
 to get a good overview of a program.  Ideally, a function should fit on one
 screen (say, 20-30 lines).  20 lines of Python can do a lot more work than 20
 lines of C.  This is not solely due to the lack of begin/end brackets -- the
 lack of declarations and the high-level data types are also responsible -- but
 the indentation-based syntax certainly helps.

 In base 2, 1/2 = 0.1, 1/4 = 0.01, 1/8 = 0.001, etc.  .2 equals 2/10 equals 1/5,

 Floating point numbers only have 32 or 64 bits of precision, so the digits are
 cut off at some point, and the resulting number is 0.199999999999999996 in
 decimal, not 0.2.
 
 A floating point number's ``repr()`` function prints as many digits are
 necessary to make ``eval(repr(f)) == f`` true for any float f.  The ``str()``
 function prints fewer digits and this often results in the more sensible number
 that was probably intended::
 
-   >>> 0.2
-   0.20000000000000001
-   >>> print 0.2
+   >>> 1.1 - 0.9
+   0.20000000000000007
+   >>> print 1.1 - 0.9
    0.2
 
 One of the consequences of this is that it is error-prone to compare the result
 of some computation to a float with ``==``. Tiny inaccuracies may mean that
 ``==`` fails.  Instead, you have to check that the difference between the two
 numbers is less than a certain threshold::
 
    epsilon = 0.0000000000001  # Tiny allowed error
    expected_result = 0.4
 
    if expected_result-epsilon <= computation() <= expected_result+epsilon:
        ...
