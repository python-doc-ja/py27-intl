   Note: Using :func:`eval` is slow and dangerous.  If you don't have absolute
   control over the contents of the string, someone could pass a string that
   resulted in an arbitrary function being executed.
 
 Is there an equivalent to Perl's chomp() for removing trailing newlines from strings?
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Starting with Python 2.2, you can use ``S.rstrip("\r\n")`` to remove all
-occurences of any line terminator from the end of the string ``S`` without
+occurrences of any line terminator from the end of the string ``S`` without
 removing other trailing whitespace.  If the string ``S`` represents more than
 one line, with several empty lines at the end, the line terminators for all the
 blank lines will be removed::
 
    >>> lines = ("line 1 \r\n"
    ...          "\r\n"
    ...          "\r\n")
    >>> lines.rstrip("\n\r")
    'line 1 '
 
 Since this is typically only desired when reading text one line at a time, using
 ``S.rstrip()`` this way works well.

 Is there a scanf() or sscanf() equivalent?
 ------------------------------------------
 
 Not as such.
 
 For simple input parsing, the easiest approach is usually to split the line into
 whitespace-delimited words using the :meth:`~str.split` method of string objects
 and then convert decimal strings to numeric values using :func:`int` or
 :func:`float`.  ``split()`` supports an optional "sep" parameter which is useful
 if the line uses something other than whitespace as a separator.

-:cfunc:`sscanf` and better suited for the task.

 What does 'UnicodeError: ASCII [decoding,encoding] error: ordinal not in range(128)' mean?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 This error indicates that your Python installation can handle only 7-bit ASCII
 strings.  There are a couple ways to fix or work around the problem.
 
 If your programs must handle data in arbitrary character set encodings, the
 environment the application runs in will generally identify the encoding of the
 data it is handing you.  You need to convert the input to Unicode data using
 that encoding.  For example, a program that handles email or web input will
