 .. describe:: toctree
 
    This directive inserts a "TOC tree" at the current location, using the
    individual TOCs (including "sub-TOC trees") of the files given in the
    directive body.  A numeric ``maxdepth`` option may be given to indicate the
    depth of the tree; by default, all levels are included.
 
    Consider this example (taken from the library reference index)::
 
       .. toctree::
          :maxdepth: 2
 
-         intro.rst
-         strings.rst
-         datatypes.rst
-         numeric.rst
+         intro
+         strings
+         datatypes
+         numeric
          (many more files listed here)
 
    This accomplishes two things:
 
    * Tables of contents from all those files are inserted, with a maximum depth
      of two, that means one nested heading.  ``toctree`` directives in those
      files are also taken into account.

+   * Sphinx knows that the relative order of the files ``intro``,
+     ``strings`` and so forth, and it knows that they are children of the
      shown file, the library index.  From this information it generates "next
      chapter", "previous chapter" and "parent chapter" links.
 
    In the end, all files included in the build process must occur in one
    ``toctree`` directive; Sphinx will emit a warning if it finds a file that is
    not included, because that means that this file will not be reachable through
    standard navigation.
 
    The special file ``contents.rst`` at the root of the source directory is the
    "root" of the TOC tree hierarchy; from it the "Contents" page is generated.
