 .. note::
 
    GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL.  All
    Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without
    making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to
    combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others
    don't.
 
 Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to
 make these releases possible.

    - Use binascii module to do the actual line-by-line conversion
      between ascii and binary. This results in a 1000-fold speedup. The C
      version is still 5 times faster, though.
